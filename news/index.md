# Changelog

## FastSurvival 1.2.0

This release corrects errors and documentation found while preparing an
article on the package. It adds no new features.

### Bug fixes

- [`print.simsummary_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/print.simsummary_fast.md)
  failed with an error for a selection of the columns of a
  [`simsummary_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/simsummary_fast.md)
  result, which keeps the class but not the boundary settings, and for a
  selection of rows without any look row. Such subsets are now printed
  as ordinary data frames. A selection of rows that keeps only some of
  the looks, or rows in a different order, paired the boundaries and
  information fractions with the wrong looks or failed; it is now also
  printed as an ordinary data frame, and the report is printed only when
  every block keeps all its looks in their original order. The boundary
  columns are labeled `Efficacy Bound` and `Futility Bound`, because the
  statistic need not be a Z-score.

- The median survival time of
  [`medsurv_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/medsurv_fast.md)
  and of the `"medsurv"` statistic of
  [`analysis_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/analysis_fast.md)
  was infinite when the Kaplan-Meier estimate of a group stayed at 0.5
  up to an infinite observed time (subjects with `tte = Inf` at a look
  that is not reached), and with `method = "nph"` the test then gave
  `z = Inf` and `p = 0`. The midpoint of such a stretch is not defined,
  and the median and the statistics that depend on it are now `NA`. The
  median printed by
  [`print.kmcurve_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/print.kmcurve_fast.md)
  follows the same rule.

- [`simdata_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/simdata_fast.md)
  truncated a group size that is a whole number up to rounding error,
  such as `90 * 0.7` (62.99999999999999), to the integer below, so the
  group had one subject fewer, and with `fixed.alloc = TRUE` and
  subgroups the C++ kernel wrote past the end of a buffer. The sizes are
  now rounded, and the kernels check that the fixed subgroup counts add
  up to the group size. The data simulated for such sizes change.

- The modestly-weighted log-rank test (`weight = "mwlrt"` in
  [`survdiff_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/survdiff_fast.md)
  and
  [`analysis_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/analysis_fast.md))
  capped the weights at 1, which gives the ordinary log-rank test, when
  the pooled Kaplan-Meier estimate reached 0 before `t_star` (within a
  stratum for the stratified test). The weights `1 / S(t-)` are now not
  capped in this case, as the definition `1 / max(S(t-), S(t_star-))`
  and nphRCT imply.

- [`analysis_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/analysis_fast.md)
  and
  [`cutoff_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/cutoff_fast.md)
  accepted negative event times, which the analysis kernel sorted after
  all positive times, and they placed a negative zero (`-0`) last,
  unlike the stand-alone functions. Negative times are now an error, and
  `-0` is treated as 0.

- An event indicator given as a factor with the levels “0” and “1”
  passed the checks of most functions and was then replaced by its
  integer codes 1 and 2, which exchanges events and censored
  observations (for example in
  [`milestone_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/milestone_fast.md),
  [`ahr_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/ahr_fast.md),
  [`analysis_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/analysis_fast.md),
  and
  [`cutoff_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/cutoff_fast.md)).
  Factor and character event indicators are now an error.
  [`medsurv_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/medsurv_fast.md),
  [`wmst_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/wmst_fast.md),
  and
  [`wkm_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/wkm_fast.md)
  now also reject non-numeric and negative times, which they sorted as
  text or accepted.

- [`wmst_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/wmst_fast.md)
  returned infinite or `NaN` values when `tau2` was not supplied and
  each group had an infinite observed time. `tau2` must now be finite,
  and an error asks for it when its default is infinite.

- [`simdata_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/simdata_fast.md)
  with the illness-death model and without `prevalence` did not check
  `switch.prop` (a percentage such as 40 made every subject switch) or
  the length of per-group lists (a third element was ignored). Both are
  now checked as with `prevalence`. A multi-arm `n` with the
  illness-death model now gives the error message intended for it.

- [`gen_scenario_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/gen_scenario_fast.md)
  kept a shared `e.hazard` when a scenario gave `e.median` (and likewise
  for the other hazard and median pairs), so the printed and plotted
  scenario used the shared hazard, and
  [`simdata_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/simdata_fast.md)
  failed with the merged arguments. A scenario value now replaces the
  other member of the pair in `shared`.

- [`analysis_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/analysis_fast.md)
  reported `NA` for the per-group average hazards of `"ahsw"` whenever
  the contrasts were not defined, for example for a group without events
  up to `tau`. Finite average hazards are now reported, as in
  [`ahsw_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/ahsw_fast.md).

- [`analysis_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/analysis_fast.md)
  combined several `strata` columns through pasted labels, so values
  containing “.” could merge two strata. The columns are now combined
  through their integer codes.

- Clearer errors:
  [`analysis_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/analysis_fast.md)
  for an empty `mc.rho`, a `conf.level` that is `NA` or not a single
  value, and a `by.subgroup` that is not `TRUE` or `FALSE`, and it names
  `event.looks` or `time.looks` in the message about non-positive looks;
  [`simdata_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/simdata_fast.md)
  names the breakpoint argument (`d.time`, `h01.time`, and so on) in the
  messages about piecewise hazards and requires a whole-number `nsim`;
  [`kmcurve_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/kmcurve_fast.md)
  rejects missing group values.

- The weighted Kaplan-Meier test
  ([`wkm_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/wkm_fast.md)
  and the `"wkm"` statistic of
  [`analysis_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/analysis_fast.md))
  returned `NaN` or an infinite weighted difference when an observed
  time was infinite, for example for a subject without a finite event or
  dropout time (a cure fraction without dropout) at a look of
  [`analysis_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/analysis_fast.md)
  that is not reached. The integral over the observed range is not
  defined in this case, and all the statistics are now `NA`.

### Documentation

- [`maxcombo_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/maxcombo_fast.md)
  and
  [`analysis_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/analysis_fast.md)
  now describe the precision of the max-combo p-value correctly. The
  weights of G(0,1) and G(1,0) add up to the weight of G(0,0), so the
  correlation matrix of the default weights is singular, and the
  quasi-Monte-Carlo GenzBretz integral converges slowly: with the
  default `maxpts` the error of the p-value is of the order of 1e-4
  rather than `abseps`. The statement that `abseps` can be loosened with
  negligible effect is removed.

- The description of `mc.alpha` in
  [`analysis_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/analysis_fast.md),
  the README, and three vignettes is corrected. The decisions that the
  Bonferroni bounds settle are those of the exact p-values. The other
  p-values are integrated as without `mc.alpha`, but the GenzBretz
  integration uses random numbers, so near the level a decision can
  differ from that of a run without `mc.alpha`, as it can between two
  runs with different seeds. The statement that the decisions are the
  same as with every p-value integrated is removed.

- The speed-comparison vignette now gives the ratio of the time per
  simulated trial with simtrial or TrialSimulator to that with
  FastSurvival as about two orders of magnitude, because the ratio
  varies between runs, and states that the one-second timing of 10,000
  trials comes from a separate benchmark with a delayed treatment
  effect.

- The page ranges of Cox (1972) and Gehan (1965) follow the publishers’
  records (187-202 and 203-224), and the `mrct-regional-consistency`
  vignette states the result of Homma (2024) for binary outcomes more
  precisely. The `group-sequential-design` vignette attributes its
  planning assumptions to the trial protocol.

- The reference to an unpublished manuscript on the Pike-Halley
  Estimator is removed. The documentation of
  [`coxph_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/coxph_fast.md)
  describes the computation.

- The documentation of
  [`coxph_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/coxph_fast.md)
  and the README describe the correction as a Halley correction expanded
  to second order, and no longer cite Berry, Kitchin, and Mock (1991)
  for the statement that the error of the Pike anchor does not vanish
  with the sample size (their simulation has a fixed sample size). The
  README no longer quotes a result on the `pharmacoSmoking` data that
  has no source in the package, and describes
  [`survfit_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/survfit_fast.md)
  as more than an order of magnitude faster than
  [`survfit()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/survival/man/survfit.html) plus
  [`summary()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/summary.html).

- [`milestone_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/milestone_fast.md)
  defines its three test statistics. The `"mover"` statistic is obtained
  by inverting the interval at `conf.level`, so the statistic and its
  p-value depend on `conf.level` (a code comment said the opposite), and
  the `"loglog"` statistic is negative when treatment is better. The
  print methods of
  [`coxph_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/coxph_fast.md),
  [`rmst_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/rmst_fast.md),
  [`milestone_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/milestone_fast.md),
  [`medsurv_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/medsurv_fast.md),
  and
  [`ahr_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/ahr_fast.md)
  label the p-value of a one-sided test `Pr(<z)` or `Pr(>z)`, and their
  documentation no longer calls the p-value two-sided.

- [`analysis_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/analysis_fast.md)
  states that no warning is given when `tau`, `t.eval`, or `wmst.tau2`
  exceeds the follow-up of a group at a look (the stand-alone functions
  warn), that `conf.level` applies to every confidence interval, that
  `maxcombo.stat` and `rmw.stat` depend on `side`, that all events at
  the calendar time of the target event are included, and when the
  stratified test reduces to the ordinary one within a subgroup.

- [`simdata_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/simdata_fast.md)
  and
  [`switch_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/switch_fast.md)
  describe the random numbers used when `seed` is not supplied, which
  [`set.seed()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/Random.html) does not control.
  The package now requires dqrng 0.4.0 or later, whose default generator
  is the Xoroshiro128++ generator described in the documentation.
  [`simdata_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/simdata_fast.md)
  also states the rounding rule of `fixed.alloc = TRUE` and cites
  Fleischer, Gaschler-Markefski, and Bluhmki (2009) for the
  maximal-independence model.

- [`wkm_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/wkm_fast.md)
  explains that the constant and square-root weights can be biased when
  follow-up differs between the groups, because the curve of the group
  with shorter follow-up is carried forward.

- Vignettes: `compare-logrank-rmst` says that the sample size comes from
  the Lachin and Foulkes method of
  [`gsDesign::nSurv()`](https://keaven.github.io/gsDesign//reference/nSurv.html)
  (not the Schoenfeld formula); `group-sequential-design` says that the
  trial planned to enroll 482 patients, gives the section of the
  protocol, and states the type I error for overall survival;
  `correlated-pfs-os-gsd` requires a median overall survival longer than
  the median progression-free survival; and the computing times are
  described as they were measured.

- Smaller corrections: the variances of the two group shares of
  [`ahr_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/ahr_fast.md)
  are equal algebraically (code comments); the example of a zero
  variance in
  [`survdiff_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/survdiff_fast.md)
  and
  [`rmw_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/rmw_fast.md);
  “orthant” instead of “half-space” for the one-sided max-combo and rMW
  regions; the left-continuous form of the modestly-weighted weight;
  “Kalbfleisch and Prentice” and the spelling “Öhrn”; the print-edition
  ISBN of Collett (2014) in `DESCRIPTION`; the issue numbers of
  Gehan (1965) and Tarone and Ware (1977); and the formatting of several
  references.

### Tests

- The one-sided max-combo p-values with three and four weights, whose
  correlation matrices are singular, are compared with an independent
  numerical integral that uses this structure.

- New tests cover the printing of subsets of
  [`simsummary_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/simsummary_fast.md)
  results and the weighted Kaplan-Meier test with infinite times. The
  tests of
  [`print.simsummary_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/print.simsummary_fast.md)
  are moved to their own file.

- A test checks that the switching proportion, the hazard after
  switching, and the dropout hazard of the illness-death model of
  [`simdata_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/simdata_fast.md)
  can differ by subgroup.

- New tests cover each bug fix above. The comparisons of the max-combo
  p-values with the pure-R reference set the seed and use an absolute
  tolerance, so that they no longer depend on the state left by earlier
  tests. The rMW p-value is compared with an independent one-dimensional
  integral. The data generated without `stream` are compared with data
  printed by FastSurvival 1.0.0, before `stream` existed. A test no
  longer turns an error of
  [`medsurv_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/medsurv_fast.md)
  into a skip, and the error expectations give the expected messages.

## FastSurvival 1.1.0

CRAN release: 2026-10-08

### New features

- New
  [`cutoff_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/cutoff_fast.md)
  computes the calendar time of each analysis look in every simulated
  trial in a single C++ pass, from a target number of events, a planned
  calendar time, a maximum calendar time, a minimum time after the
  previous look, and a minimum follow-up after a given number of
  enrolled subjects, combined as `min(max(...), maximum time)` as in
  [`simtrial::get_analysis_date()`](https://merck.github.io/simtrial/reference/get_analysis_date.html).
  Events can be counted on a subset of the subjects (for example the
  control group) or on another endpoint (for example the PFS columns of
  an illness-death simulation), and the event targets can be given per
  simulated trial.

- [`analysis_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/analysis_fast.md)
  gains a `cutoff.looks` argument, a matrix of per-simulation calendar
  cutoffs (such as the output of
  [`cutoff_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/cutoff_fast.md)),
  as an alternative to `event.looks` and `time.looks`. This analyzes an
  endpoint at cutoffs determined by another endpoint, by a subset of the
  subjects, or by combined trigger rules, within the same fused C++
  loop.

- [`pairwise_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/pairwise_fast.md)
  gains a `cutoff.looks` argument, and its event-driven mode now
  computes the shared cutoffs with
  [`cutoff_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/cutoff_fast.md)
  and analyzes every contrast through `cutoff.looks` instead of
  re-cutting the data in R. The results are unchanged.

- New
  [`switch_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/switch_fast.md)
  applies treatment switching to simulated data, changing only the
  outcomes after each subject’s switch: at the intermediate event of an
  illness-death simulation (for example progression), at an opening time
  after an interim analysis (crossover at a milestone, optionally only
  in the simulated trials selected by an interim decision), or at the
  later of the two. The remaining time to the terminal event is
  multiplied by an acceleration factor (the causal model of the RPSFT
  method) or redrawn from a new (piecewise) exponential hazard. Outcomes
  observed before the opening time are unchanged, so an interim analysis
  is unaffected by the switching.

- [`analysis_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/analysis_fast.md)
  gains an `mc.alpha` argument, the nominal levels at which the
  `"maxcombo"` p-values are compared. The p-value is then integrated
  only when the Bonferroni bounds `p_min <= p <= K * p_min` do not
  decide the comparison with the level; otherwise the bound on the same
  side of the level is reported. The decisions at the levels (for
  example in `simsummary_fast(p.col = "maxcombo.p", alpha = mc.alpha)`)
  are those of the exact p-values, and a `maxcombo.p.exact` column marks
  the integrated rows. The default (`NULL`) computes every p-value as
  before.

- The illness-death model of
  [`simdata_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/simdata_fast.md)
  now supports subgroups through `prevalence` and `fixed.alloc`
  ([\#3](https://github.com/gosukehommaEX/FastSurvival/issues/3),
  suggested by Isaac Gravestock). The transition hazards, `switch.prop`,
  and the dropout specification accept per-group and per-cell nested
  lists with the same rules as `e.hazard`, for example
  `h01.hazard = list(list(0.10, 0.06), 0.05)`, so a mixture of
  illness-death models is simulated in one call. All subjects share one
  accrual process and the subgroups are assigned after accrual, so they
  enroll over the same calendar in proportion to their prevalence.
  Without `prevalence` the results are unchanged.

- [`simdata_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/simdata_fast.md)
  gains a `stream` argument that selects an independent `dqrng`
  random-number stream for the given `seed`, so that a large simulation
  can be generated in reproducible batches, sequentially or in parallel.
  Without `stream` the results are unchanged.

### Bug fixes

- [`analysis_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/analysis_fast.md)
  with `stat = "maxcombo"`, `side = 2`, and two or three weights failed
  with “TVPACK either needs all(lower == -Inf) or all(upper == Inf)”,
  because the two-sided rectangle was passed to the TVPACK algorithm,
  which handles only half-spaces. It now uses the GenzBretz algorithm in
  that case, as
  [`maxcombo_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/maxcombo_fast.md)
  does.

- [`wkm_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/wkm_fast.md)
  and `stat = "wkm"` of
  [`analysis_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/analysis_fast.md)
  divided the variance terms by the selected weight instead of the
  Pepe-Fleming weight, which is the censoring factor of the variance
  whatever weight is used. The results with `weight = "PF"` (the
  default) are unchanged. With `"sqrtPF"` and `"constant"` the standard
  error was too small and the test anti-conservative; for the constant
  weight under uniform censoring, the empirical standard deviation of
  the weighted difference was about 1.15 times the mean standard error.
  The error dates from version 0.2.0.

- [`simdata_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/simdata_fast.md)
  recorded a subject with neither a finite survival time nor a finite
  dropout time (possible with a zero hazard in the last piece, such as a
  cure fraction, and no dropout) as an event at an infinite time, so an
  event-driven look of
  [`analysis_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/analysis_fast.md)
  could be reached at an infinite cutoff. Such a subject now has
  `tte = Inf` and `event = 0`, in the single-endpoint and illness-death
  models and in
  [`switch_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/switch_fast.md),
  and is counted as in follow-up, not as a dropout, at an unreached look
  of
  [`analysis_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/analysis_fast.md).
  A zero hazard no longer gives `NaN` when the draw equals the
  cumulative hazard at the last breakpoint.

- In the illness-death model of
  [`simdata_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/simdata_fast.md),
  a switch through `switch.prop` could occur at an intermediate event
  after dropout, which is not observed. A switch now requires the
  intermediate event on or before dropout. The observed columns are
  unchanged; only the latent terminal time, `switched`, and
  `switch_time` of the affected subjects (who have dropped out before
  the intermediate event) change. The column `intermediate` describes
  the latent process, as the documentation now states.

- [`milestone_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/milestone_fast.md)
  and `stat = "milestone"` with `method = "loglog"` or `"mover"`
  returned missing confidence limits when the Kaplan-Meier estimate of a
  group was 0 or 1 at `tau`. The one-sample interval of that group now
  degenerates to the estimate, so the interval of the difference is
  reported; the `"loglog"` test statistic remains `NA` in that case.

- [`simdata_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/simdata_fast.md)
  with a single-level prevalence (for example `prevalence = 1`) did not
  output the subgroup column.

- [`analysis_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/analysis_fast.md)
  converted an `event.looks` target beyond the integer range to an
  undefined integer in C++. Such a target is now capped, as in
  [`cutoff_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/cutoff_fast.md),
  and is never reached.

- [`switch_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/switch_fast.md)
  matched a named `cutoff` vector by position. The names are now matched
  to `data$sim`, as in the `cutoff.looks` argument of
  [`analysis_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/analysis_fast.md).

### Input validation

- With `presorted = TRUE`,
  [`survdiff_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/survdiff_fast.md),
  [`coxph_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/coxph_fast.md),
  [`rmst_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/rmst_fast.md),
  [`wmst_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/wmst_fast.md),
  [`milestone_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/milestone_fast.md),
  [`medsurv_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/medsurv_fast.md),
  [`maxcombo_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/maxcombo_fast.md),
  [`rmw_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/rmw_fast.md),
  [`wkm_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/wkm_fast.md),
  [`ahsw_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/ahsw_fast.md),
  and
  [`ahr_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/ahr_fast.md)
  now check the order in a single pass (with strata, also that the rows
  of each stratum are contiguous) and give an error for unsorted input
  instead of a wrong result, as
  [`survfit_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/survfit_fast.md)
  already did. The fused kernel of
  [`analysis_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/analysis_fast.md)
  is not affected.

- [`simdata_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/simdata_fast.md)
  checks that `n` contains positive whole numbers.

- [`milestone_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/milestone_fast.md),
  [`ahr_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/ahr_fast.md),
  and
  [`kmcurve_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/kmcurve_fast.md)
  check the event indicator before converting it to integer, so a value
  such as 0.7 is an error rather than a censoring, and
  [`kmcurve_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/kmcurve_fast.md)
  also rejects missing values. Negative times are rejected by
  [`milestone_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/milestone_fast.md),
  [`kmcurve_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/kmcurve_fast.md),
  and the functions that share the internal time and event check.

- [`cutoff_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/cutoff_fast.md)
  warns when the cutoff of a look precedes that of the previous look in
  some simulated trials, for example when only the later look has a
  calendar cap.

### Documentation

- New vignette “Treatment switching and crossover after an interim
  analysis” simulates crossover after a positive PFS analysis and
  switching at progression, and checks the switching model with the
  RPSFT estimator of the rpsftm package, which is added to Suggests and
  used only when it is installed.

- The correlated PFS and OS vignette now analyzes OS at the PFS-driven
  cutoffs with
  [`cutoff_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/cutoff_fast.md)
  and `cutoff.looks`.

- The validation vignette compares
  [`cutoff_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/cutoff_fast.md)
  with
  [`simtrial::get_analysis_date()`](https://merck.github.io/simtrial/reference/get_analysis_date.html)
  and the survival times generated by
  [`switch_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/switch_fast.md)
  with their analytic distribution. It no longer states a reproduction
  of published p-values that the package sources do not contain, and it
  describes the p-values of
  [`nph::logrank.maxtest()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/nph/man/logrank.maxtest.html)
  correctly (they are two-sided).

- New vignette “Using your own data generator” analyzes trials generated
  outside the package (Weibull survival with a cure fraction) with
  [`cutoff_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/cutoff_fast.md),
  [`analysis_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/analysis_fast.md),
  [`switch_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/switch_fast.md),
  and
  [`simsummary_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/simsummary_fast.md),
  and lists the columns each function reads.

- The group sequential design vignette is now evaluated when it is built
  instead of showing static output. The closed-form reference is
  computed with
  [`gsDesign::gsProbability()`](https://keaven.github.io/gsDesign//reference/gsProbability.html)
  and the expected-event curve, and the non-proportional hazards example
  compares the log-rank and max-combo tests with `mc.alpha`. The rpact
  package is no longer used and is removed from Suggests.

- In the correlated PFS and OS vignette, the hierarchical rule now
  claims OS at the first look, from the PFS claim onward, at which OS
  crosses its boundary (Glimm, Maurer, and Bretz, 2010). The previous
  code used only the first OS crossing, so an OS crossing before the PFS
  claim prevented a later OS claim and the hierarchical OS power was
  understated. A duplicated row of the power table is removed.

- The multi-arm vignette computes the global-null error rates with
  [`pairwise_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/pairwise_fast.md),
  the multiregional vignette generates the regions from `dqrng` streams,
  and the Freidlin and Korn vignette draws the scenario with
  [`gen_scenario_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/gen_scenario_fast.md)
  and uses `mc.alpha` for the max-combo test.

- The convergence statement of
  [`coxph_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/coxph_fast.md)
  (help page and README) is corrected. The residual error of the
  Pike-Halley Estimator is of the order of the cube of the error of the
  Pike anchor; it is negligible near the null hypothesis, but at a fixed
  hazard ratio away from 1 the Pike anchor keeps a bias that does not
  vanish with the sample size, so the residual error levels off at a
  small value rather than decreasing at the rate O_p(n^{-3/2}) stated
  before.

- Help pages corrected or completed: the eligibility condition of
  [`switch_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/switch_fast.md)
  for single-endpoint data includes dropout; the rules of
  [`cutoff_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/cutoff_fast.md)
  for a look with only `max.time`, after an unreached look, and for
  looks out of order; the treatment of an unreached look in
  [`analysis_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/analysis_fast.md),
  [`pairwise_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/pairwise_fast.md),
  and
  [`simsummary_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/simsummary_fast.md);
  the meaning of `intermediate` and `switched` in
  [`simdata_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/simdata_fast.md);
  the scale of `std.err` in
  [`survfit_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/survfit_fast.md)
  compared with
  [`survival::survfit()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/survival/man/survfit.html);
  the `side` argument of
  [`coxph_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/coxph_fast.md),
  whose return value has no p-value; the tests of
  [`rmst_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/rmst_fast.md)
  and
  [`ahsw_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/ahsw_fast.md),
  which follow `side`; and the description of
  [`kmcurve_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/kmcurve_fast.md)
  in the package overview, which has no risk table.

- The validation vignette compares
  [`coxph_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/coxph_fast.md)
  with [`coxph()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/survival/man/coxph.html) using
  `ties = "breslow"`, the partial likelihood that the Pike-Halley
  Estimator approximates, and reports the difference from the computed
  values.

- The correlated PFS and OS vignette corrects the description of the
  events shared by the two endpoints and states that the OS information
  fractions are planning values and that the family-wise error rate is
  not evaluated there.

- Other vignette corrections: the Freidlin and Korn vignette describes
  the FH(0,1) weights correctly (bounded, but close to zero for early
  events); the multiregional vignette no longer attributes the
  hazard-reduction criterion to Teng et al. (2018), states the
  comparison of Method 1 and Method 2 as an observation, and removes a
  statement on scope that its three-region example contradicted; the
  multi-arm vignette reports the family-wise error rate with its Monte
  Carlo standard error and its normal approximation; the
  compare-logrank-rmst vignette draws the Kaplan-Meier curves of the
  data censored at the analysis; the speed comparison states the
  measurement conditions; and references listed but not cited are now
  cited in the text.

- README: the nominal levels of the workflow example are now those of
  the Lan-DeMets O’Brien-Fleming-type spending at 300 and 450 events;
  the return values of
  [`milestone_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/milestone_fast.md)
  and
  [`ahr_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/ahr_fast.md)
  are lists; and the agreement of `medsurv_fast(method = "nph")` with
  the nph package is stated for coinciding Kaplan-Meier and Nelson-Aalen
  medians.

### Tests

- New tests for
  [`gen_scenario_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/gen_scenario_fast.md),
  [`plot.scenario_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/plot.scenario_fast.md),
  and the print methods that had none, and for the `mc.alpha` shortcut
  of
  [`analysis_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/analysis_fast.md).

- New tests for the fixes above: the variance of
  [`wkm_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/wkm_fast.md)
  for every weight against an independent reference and a calibration of
  its standard error by simulation; data with infinite latent times;
  switching and dropout in the illness-death model; degenerate milestone
  intervals; the order check of `presorted = TRUE`; and the input
  checks.

- New tests for subgroups in the illness-death model: a single cell
  reproduces the data without subgroups, each cell follows its own
  transition hazards, a subgroup matches its separate simulation with
  the accrual rate scaled by the prevalence, and the output works with
  [`analysis_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/analysis_fast.md),
  [`cutoff_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/cutoff_fast.md),
  and
  [`switch_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/switch_fast.md).

## FastSurvival 1.0.0

CRAN release: 2026-09-29

### New features

- [`coxph_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/coxph_fast.md)
  gains a `strata` argument for a stratified Pike-Halley estimate of a
  common hazard ratio with a separate baseline hazard in each stratum
  ([\#1](https://github.com/gosukehommaEX/FastSurvival/issues/1),
  suggested by Isaac Gravestock). The risk sets are formed within each
  stratum, and the observed and expected totals, the score, the
  information, and the curvature term are summed over strata, so the
  result approximates `coxph(... + strata(s), ties = "breslow")`. The
  `strata` argument of
  [`analysis_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/analysis_fast.md)
  now also stratifies `stat = "coxph"`.

### Bug fixes

- [`simdata_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/simdata_fast.md)
  with subgroups failed when the sample size was given as a scalar `n`
  with `alloc`
  ([\#2](https://github.com/gosukehommaEX/FastSurvival/issues/2),
  reported by Isaac Gravestock), because a scalar `n` with a common
  prevalence was always treated as a single group. A scalar `n` now
  gives a two-group simulation when `alloc` is supplied explicitly or
  when a survival or dropout specification is a per-group list with
  per-cell elements (such as `list(list(0.10, 0.08, 0.06), 0.05)`), and
  the result is identical to the per-group `n` specification. Without
  either signal, a list with subgroups is still read as per-cell values
  of a single group. The rules are described in the Details of
  [`?simdata_fast`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/simdata_fast.md).
  In the same area:
  - a shared (non-list) survival or dropout specification is accepted in
    a two-group simulation with subgroups;
  - lists of the wrong length are reported instead of being silently
    truncated or failing with “subscript out of bounds”;
  - per-cell `e.time` and `d.time` lists are honored in a one-group
    simulation with subgroups;
  - group-specific prevalence must use the same number of levels for
    each factor in both groups;
  - the illness-death model also treats an explicit `alloc` as a
    two-group request;
  - without subgroups, a scalar `n` with an explicit `alloc` and a
    shared (non-list) hazard now gives two groups sharing that hazard,
    where it previously gave one group of size `n` and ignored `alloc`.
- [`analysis_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/analysis_fast.md)
  with `stat = "milestone"`, `ms.method = "loglog"`, and `side = 1`
  returned the upper-tail p-value although the log-log statistic is
  negative under treatment benefit, so the one-sided p-value was
  approximately one minus the correct value. It now uses the lower tail,
  as
  [`milestone_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/milestone_fast.md)
  does.
- [`analysis_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/analysis_fast.md)
  now reports the `"ahsw"` p-values according to `side`, as
  [`ahsw_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/ahsw_fast.md)
  does; they were always two-sided before.
- [`pairwise_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/pairwise_fast.md)
  in event-driven mode reported every administratively censored subject
  as a dropout (`n.pipeline` was always 0). Dropout and pipeline counts
  are now computed at the per-simulation cutoff. The event-driven mode
  also keeps the other columns of `data`, so `strata` works there, and
  an ambiguous `p.col` (several statistics) is reported clearly.
- The log-rank family
  ([`survdiff_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/survdiff_fast.md),
  [`maxcombo_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/maxcombo_fast.md),
  [`rmw_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/rmw_fast.md),
  and the weighted and stratified variants) left out of the observed and
  expected counts an event at a time when only one subject was at risk.
  The test statistics were unaffected, but the printed counts differed
  from
  [`survival::survdiff()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/survival/man/survdiff.html).
- [`medsurv_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/medsurv_fast.md)
  (and `stat = "medsurv"` in
  [`analysis_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/analysis_fast.md))
  now follows the
  [`survival::survfit()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/survival/man/survfit.html)
  median convention: the comparison with 0.5 uses a tolerance, and a
  curve that equals 0.5 on a flat stretch gives the midpoint of that
  stretch. Before, floating-point rounding could move the median to the
  next event time. With `method = "km"` the kernel hazard is evaluated
  at the new median, so its standard error changes in the flat-stretch
  case as well. The printed median of
  [`kmcurve_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/kmcurve_fast.md)
  objects uses the same step-function rule instead of linear
  interpolation.
- [`simdata_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/simdata_fast.md)
  with a scalar `n` split the total with
  [`round()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/Round.html), which could lose or
  add a subject (for example `n = 7` gave 4 + 4). The split now always
  adds up to `n`, and `alloc` is validated.
- [`simdata_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/simdata_fast.md)
  with `fixed.alloc = TRUE` assigned the subgroup cells in contiguous
  blocks, so subgroup membership was tied to the accrual interval. The
  fixed labels are now randomly permuted within each simulation, which
  changes the generated data for `fixed.alloc = TRUE` (only) for a given
  seed. The fixed counts are also protected against floating-point
  shares such as `100 * 0.29`.
- [`simdata_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/simdata_fast.md)
  in the illness-death model now treats a per-group `d.hazard` or
  `d.median` list as a two-group request, as in the single-endpoint
  model.
- [`milestone_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/milestone_fast.md)
  (and `stat = "milestone"`) returned a `NaN` standard error when a
  Kaplan-Meier curve reached zero by the milestone; it is now 0, as in
  [`survfit_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/survfit_fast.md).
- [`survfit_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/survfit_fast.md)
  caps the upper limit of the `"log"` interval at 1 and gives a
  degenerate interval when the standard error is zero, as
  [`survival::survfit()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/survival/man/survfit.html)
  does.
- The print method of
  [`survdiff_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/survdiff_fast.md)
  labels the unweighted stratified test as stratified.
- [`simsummary_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/simsummary_fast.md)
  silently kept only the last row when `data` had more than one row per
  simulation and look, such as the stacked arms of
  [`pairwise_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/pairwise_fast.md)
  output. It now summarizes each arm separately when `data` has an `arm`
  column (the output gains an `arm` column and the print method a
  heading per arm), and stops with an error for other duplicated rows.
- The print method of
  [`simsummary_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/simsummary_fast.md)
  no longer runs the label “Expected analysis time at stop:” into its
  value.

### Input validation

- [`rmst_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/rmst_fast.md),
  [`ahsw_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/ahsw_fast.md),
  [`milestone_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/milestone_fast.md),
  [`wmst_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/wmst_fast.md)
  (a supplied `tau2`), and
  [`ahr_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/ahr_fast.md)
  (a supplied `tau`) warn when the truncation time or milestone exceeds
  the largest observed time of a group, where the Kaplan-Meier curve is
  not estimated and is carried forward flat.
- [`survdiff_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/survdiff_fast.md),
  [`coxph_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/coxph_fast.md),
  [`rmst_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/rmst_fast.md),
  [`maxcombo_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/maxcombo_fast.md),
  [`rmw_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/rmw_fast.md),
  [`ahsw_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/ahsw_fast.md),
  [`survfit_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/survfit_fast.md),
  and
  [`analysis_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/analysis_fast.md)
  now check that `event` is coded 0/1 without missing values and, for
  the two-group functions, that `group` has exactly two values without
  missing values and that `control` is one of them. Before, a wrong
  `control` label or a 1/2 event coding silently produced wrong or
  missing results.
- [`analysis_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/analysis_fast.md)
  requires whole-number `event.looks` and recodes factor and character
  subgroup columns consistently, so `by.subgroup = TRUE` labels the
  populations correctly for such columns.
- [`survfit_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/survfit_fast.md)
  checks that `t_sorted` and `e_sorted` have the same length and, with
  `presorted = TRUE`, that the times are sorted.
- [`simdata_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/simdata_fast.md)
  checks that hazards are non-negative and that piecewise breakpoints
  start at 0 and increase, and that the output fits in an R vector.
- [`milestone_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/milestone_fast.md),
  [`medsurv_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/medsurv_fast.md),
  and
  [`wmst_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/wmst_fast.md)
  reject missing times or groups.

### Documentation

- The modestly-weighted weight cap is documented as `1 / S(t_star-)`,
  the pooled Kaplan-Meier value just before `t_star`, which is what the
  code computes (as in nphRCT).
- The speed-comparison vignette reports speed gains re-measured for this
  release.
- The validation vignette compares the stratified
  [`coxph_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/coxph_fast.md)
  with [`coxph()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/survival/man/coxph.html) using
  [`strata()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/survival/man/strata.html).
- The
  [`ahr_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/ahr_fast.md)
  documentation explains that, as in the `AHR` package, the estimate is
  not symmetric in the groups when both groups have events at the same
  time, so `control` should be the actual reference group.
- The
  [`ahsw_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/ahsw_fast.md)
  documentation states the actual condition for `NA` results (no events
  up to `tau` in a group).
- The
  [`analysis_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/analysis_fast.md)
  documentation no longer lists a `look.type` column, which the function
  does not return.

## FastSurvival 0.2.0

CRAN release: 2026-07-27

- New estimation and testing functions:
  - [`rmst_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/rmst_fast.md):
    restricted mean survival time for a single group or a two-group
    comparison (difference and ratio contrasts), integrating the
    Kaplan-Meier survival step function in a single C++ scan.
  - [`wmst_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/wmst_fast.md):
    window mean survival time over an interval, generalizing
    [`rmst_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/rmst_fast.md)
    (which is the special case with a lower window limit of zero), for a
    single group or a two-group difference, computed in the same single
    C++ scan with a Greenwood-type variance in which each event time
    contributes its squared remaining window area.
  - [`milestone_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/milestone_fast.md):
    two-group comparison of Kaplan-Meier survival at a milestone
    timepoint, with Wald, log-log, and MOVER inference methods.
  - [`medsurv_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/medsurv_fast.md):
    median survival time for a single group or a two-group difference,
    with a native kernel-hazard variance method and an `nph`-compatible
    local-constant-hazard method that reproduces the median comparison
    of the `nph` package to numerical precision; the point estimate is
    the same under both methods.
  - [`maxcombo_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/maxcombo_fast.md):
    max-combo test over a set of Fleming-Harrington weighted log-rank
    statistics, with the joint p-value obtained from the implied
    multivariate normal distribution.
  - [`rmw_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/rmw_fast.md):
    robust modestly-weighted log-rank test of Magirr and Öhrn, the
    maximum of the standard log-rank and a modestly-weighted log-rank
    statistic, with the joint p-value obtained from the implied
    bivariate normal distribution.
  - [`wkm_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/wkm_fast.md):
    weighted Kaplan-Meier (Pepe-Fleming) test, the weighted integrated
    difference between two Kaplan-Meier curves, with Pepe-Fleming,
    square-root, and constant weights, reproducing the weighted
    Kaplan-Meier statistic of the `nphsim` package.
  - [`ahsw_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/ahsw_fast.md):
    average hazard with survival weight of Uno and Horiguchi, reporting
    the ratio (RAH) and difference (DAH) contrasts.
  - [`ahr_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/ahr_fast.md):
    Kalbfleisch-Prentice average hazard ratio between two groups over a
    restricted interval, the estimator used by Dormuth et al. (2024) for
    sample-size calculation under non-proportional hazards, with a test
    on the group-share scale and an equivalent test and confidence
    interval on the log scale.
- [`survdiff_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/survdiff_fast.md)
  gains weighted log-rank tests (Fleming-Harrington, modestly-weighted,
  Gehan-Breslow, Tarone-Ware) and stratified and stratified-weighted
  variants, all sharing the single-scan C++ backend.
- New simulation layer:
  - [`simdata_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/simdata_fast.md)
    extended with optional subgroups defined by a prevalence
    specification and a flexible accrual specification: `a.rate` gives
    absolute accrual rates (with the end of an open final interval
    solved from the total when a trailing rate is supplied) and `a.prop`
    gives accrual proportions, with deterministic per-interval accrual
    counts. The entire generation pipeline runs in a single C++ kernel
    that materializes the output data frame once. It can also generate
    two correlated time-to-event endpoints (for example progression-free
    and overall survival) from an illness-death model with three
    transition hazards and optional treatment switching, reducing to the
    Fleischer maximal-independence model when the post-event hazard
    equals the direct terminal hazard. A vector `n` of length greater
    than two together with a per-arm survival list generates a multi-arm
    trial, each arm produced with the single-group kernel over a common
    accrual window and labeled 1 to `length(n)`, for analysis as
    pairwise contrasts against a shared control.
  - [`analysis_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/analysis_fast.md):
    interim or sequential analysis of simulated data at one or more
    looks, defined by target event counts or calendar times, computed by
    a fused C++ kernel that reuses the analysis cores of the standalone
    functions. Supports subgroup analyses.
  - [`pairwise_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/pairwise_fast.md):
    runs
    [`analysis_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/analysis_fast.md)
    for each experimental arm against a shared control on multi-arm
    data, at either fixed calendar looks or the per-simulation cutoffs
    of a designated primary contrast, and stacks the results with an
    optional Bonferroni adjustment across contrasts.
  - [`simsummary_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/simsummary_fast.md):
    operating-characteristic summary (rejection and futility rates,
    stopping-look distribution, expected timing) from
    [`analysis_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/analysis_fast.md)
    output and supplied group-sequential boundaries, with a
    [`print()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/print.html) method that lays the
    results out as a group-sequential design report.
- New visualization layer:
  - [`gen_scenario_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/gen_scenario_fast.md):
    assembles one or more two-group scenarios into a `scenario_fast`
    object for design-stage exploration, with a
    [`plot()`](https://rdrr.io/r/graphics/plot.default.html) method that
    draws the analytic survival curves and the piecewise hazard ratio of
    each scenario and a [`print()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/print.html)
    method that summarizes the medians, the start and end hazard ratios,
    and whether the curves cross.
  - [`kmcurve_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/kmcurve_fast.md):
    builds the Kaplan-Meier curves of a single trial realization (for
    example one replicate of
    [`simdata_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/simdata_fast.md))
    into a `kmcurve_fast` object, with a
    [`plot()`](https://rdrr.io/r/graphics/plot.default.html) method that
    draws the curves with optional restricted-mean shading and a
    smoothed time-varying hazard-ratio panel, and a
    [`print()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/print.html) method that
    summarizes the events and medians.
- Each estimation and testing function has a corresponding
  [`print()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/print.html) method, and the print
  methods share a unified display format.
- New vignettes accompany the analysis, simulation, and visualization
  layers: validation against established packages, a speed comparison, a
  group-sequential design reproduction, a log-rank versus RMST
  comparison under nonproportional hazards, the Freidlin-Korn
  strong-null investigation, a correlated PFS and OS group-sequential
  design under the Fleischer model, a multiregional regional-consistency
  evaluation, and a multi-arm design analyzed as pairwise contrasts
  against a shared control.

## FastSurvival 0.1.0

CRAN release: 2026-05-27

- Initial release.
- Core computations implemented in `C++` via `Rcpp` for use inside large
  simulation loops.
- [`survfit_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/survfit_fast.md):
  single-time-point Kaplan-Meier estimator with Greenwood standard error
  and plain / log / log-log confidence intervals. The C++ backend
  locates the evaluation cutoff via binary search and accumulates the
  Kaplan-Meier product and Greenwood variance sum in a single scan over
  event positions. Returns an object of class `"survfit_fast"` with a
  [`print()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/print.html) method.
- [`survdiff_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/survdiff_fast.md):
  log-rank test returning a one-sided Z-score or a two-sided chi-square
  statistic. The C++ backend uses a two-pointer merge scan over pooled
  sorted vectors, eliminating the rank construction,
  [`tabulate()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/tabulate.html), and reverse
  cumulative sum operations of the standard implementation. Returns an
  object of class `"survdiff_fast"` with a
  [`print()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/print.html) method.
- [`coxph_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/coxph_fast.md):
  closed-form hazard ratio estimator via the Pike-Halley Estimator
  method with Wald confidence interval. The C++ backend performs group
  splitting, at-risk counting, and per-distinct-event-time accumulation
  in a single pass. Returns an object of class `"coxph_fast"` with a
  [`print()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/print.html) method.
- [`simdata_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/simdata_fast.md):
  clinical trial data simulator supporting one- and two-group designs,
  piecewise uniform accrual, and simple and piecewise exponential
  survival and dropout times. C++ backends handle piecewise sampling and
  two-group interleaving, and random number generation uses `dqrng`.

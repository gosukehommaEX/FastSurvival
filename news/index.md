# Changelog

## FastSurvival (development version)

### New features

- [`coxph_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/coxph_fast.md)
  gains a `strata` argument for a stratified Pike-Halley estimate of a
  common hazard ratio with a separate baseline hazard in each stratum
  ([\#1](https://github.com/gosukehommaEX/FastSurvival/issues/1),
  suggested by Isaac Gravestock). The risk sets are formed within each
  stratum, and the observed and expected totals, the score, the
  information, and the curvature term are summed over strata, so the
  result approximates `coxph(... + strata(s), ties = "breslow")`. The
  `strata` argument of
  [`analysis_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/analysis_fast.md)
  now also stratifies `stat = "coxph"`.

### Bug fixes

- [`simdata_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/simdata_fast.md)
  with subgroups failed when the sample size was given as a scalar `n`
  with `alloc`
  ([\#2](https://github.com/gosukehommaEX/FastSurvival/issues/2),
  reported by Isaac Gravestock), because a scalar `n` with a common
  prevalence was always treated as a single group. A scalar `n` now
  gives a two-group simulation when `alloc` is supplied explicitly or
  when a survival or dropout specification is a per-group list with
  per-cell elements (such as `list(list(0.10, 0.08, 0.06), 0.05)`), and
  the result is identical to the per-group `n` specification. Without
  either signal, a list with subgroups is still read as per-cell values
  of a single group. The rules are described in the Details of
  [`?simdata_fast`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/simdata_fast.md).
  In the same area:
  - a shared (non-list) survival or dropout specification is accepted in
    a two-group simulation with subgroups;
  - lists of the wrong length are reported instead of being silently
    truncated or failing with “subscript out of bounds”;
  - per-cell `e.time` and `d.time` lists are honored in a one-group
    simulation with subgroups;
  - group-specific prevalence must use the same number of levels for
    each factor in both groups;
  - the illness-death model also treats an explicit `alloc` as a
    two-group request;
  - without subgroups, a scalar `n` with an explicit `alloc` and a
    shared (non-list) hazard now gives two groups sharing that hazard,
    where it previously gave one group of size `n` and ignored `alloc`.
- [`analysis_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/analysis_fast.md)
  with `stat = "milestone"`, `ms.method = "loglog"`, and `side = 1`
  returned the upper-tail p-value although the log-log statistic is
  negative under treatment benefit, so the one-sided p-value was
  approximately one minus the correct value. It now uses the lower tail,
  as
  [`milestone_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/milestone_fast.md)
  does.
- [`analysis_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/analysis_fast.md)
  now reports the `"ahsw"` p-values according to `side`, as
  [`ahsw_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/ahsw_fast.md)
  does; they were always two-sided before.
- [`pairwise_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/pairwise_fast.md)
  in event-driven mode reported every administratively censored subject
  as a dropout (`n.pipeline` was always 0). Dropout and pipeline counts
  are now computed at the per-simulation cutoff. The event-driven mode
  also keeps the other columns of `data`, so `strata` works there, and
  an ambiguous `p.col` (several statistics) is reported clearly.
- The log-rank family
  ([`survdiff_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/survdiff_fast.md),
  [`maxcombo_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/maxcombo_fast.md),
  [`rmw_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/rmw_fast.md),
  and the weighted and stratified variants) left out of the observed and
  expected counts an event at a time when only one subject was at risk.
  The test statistics were unaffected, but the printed counts differed
  from
  [`survival::survdiff()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/survival/man/survdiff.html).
- [`medsurv_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/medsurv_fast.md)
  (and `stat = "medsurv"` in
  [`analysis_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/analysis_fast.md))
  now follows the
  [`survival::survfit()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/survival/man/survfit.html)
  median convention: the comparison with 0.5 uses a tolerance, and a
  curve that equals 0.5 on a flat stretch gives the midpoint of that
  stretch. Before, floating-point rounding could move the median to the
  next event time. With `method = "km"` the kernel hazard is evaluated
  at the new median, so its standard error changes in the flat-stretch
  case as well. The printed median of
  [`kmcurve_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/kmcurve_fast.md)
  objects uses the same step-function rule instead of linear
  interpolation.
- [`simdata_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/simdata_fast.md)
  with a scalar `n` split the total with
  [`round()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/Round.html), which could lose or
  add a subject (for example `n = 7` gave 4 + 4). The split now always
  adds up to `n`, and `alloc` is validated.
- [`simdata_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/simdata_fast.md)
  with `fixed.alloc = TRUE` assigned the subgroup cells in contiguous
  blocks, so subgroup membership was tied to the accrual interval. The
  fixed labels are now randomly permuted within each simulation, which
  changes the generated data for `fixed.alloc = TRUE` (only) for a given
  seed. The fixed counts are also protected against floating-point
  shares such as `100 * 0.29`.
- [`simdata_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/simdata_fast.md)
  in the illness-death model now treats a per-group `d.hazard` or
  `d.median` list as a two-group request, as in the single-endpoint
  model.
- [`milestone_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/milestone_fast.md)
  (and `stat = "milestone"`) returned a `NaN` standard error when a
  Kaplan-Meier curve reached zero by the milestone; it is now 0, as in
  [`survfit_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/survfit_fast.md).
- [`survfit_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/survfit_fast.md)
  caps the upper limit of the `"log"` interval at 1 and gives a
  degenerate interval when the standard error is zero, as
  [`survival::survfit()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/survival/man/survfit.html)
  does.
- The print method of
  [`survdiff_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/survdiff_fast.md)
  labels the unweighted stratified test as stratified.
- [`simsummary_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/simsummary_fast.md)
  silently kept only the last row when `data` had more than one row per
  simulation and look, such as the stacked arms of
  [`pairwise_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/pairwise_fast.md)
  output. It now summarizes each arm separately when `data` has an `arm`
  column (the output gains an `arm` column and the print method a
  heading per arm), and stops with an error for other duplicated rows.
- The print method of
  [`simsummary_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/simsummary_fast.md)
  no longer runs the label “Expected analysis time at stop:” into its
  value.

### Input validation

- [`survdiff_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/survdiff_fast.md),
  [`coxph_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/coxph_fast.md),
  [`rmst_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/rmst_fast.md),
  [`maxcombo_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/maxcombo_fast.md),
  [`rmw_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/rmw_fast.md),
  [`ahsw_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/ahsw_fast.md),
  [`survfit_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/survfit_fast.md),
  and
  [`analysis_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/analysis_fast.md)
  now check that `event` is coded 0/1 without missing values and, for
  the two-group functions, that `group` has exactly two values without
  missing values and that `control` is one of them. Before, a mistyped
  `control` or a 1/2 event coding silently produced wrong or missing
  results.
- [`analysis_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/analysis_fast.md)
  requires whole-number `event.looks` and recodes factor and character
  subgroup columns consistently, so `by.subgroup = TRUE` labels the
  populations correctly for such columns.
- [`survfit_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/survfit_fast.md)
  checks that `t_sorted` and `e_sorted` have the same length and, with
  `presorted = TRUE`, that the times are sorted.
- [`simdata_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/simdata_fast.md)
  checks that hazards are non-negative and that piecewise breakpoints
  start at 0 and increase, and that the output fits in an R vector.
- [`milestone_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/milestone_fast.md),
  [`medsurv_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/medsurv_fast.md),
  and
  [`wmst_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/wmst_fast.md)
  reject missing times or groups.

### Documentation

- The modestly-weighted weight cap is documented as `1 / S(t_star-)`,
  the pooled Kaplan-Meier value just before `t_star`, which is what the
  code computes (as in nphRCT).
- The
  [`ahr_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/ahr_fast.md)
  documentation explains that, as in the `AHR` package, the estimate is
  not symmetric in the groups when both groups have events at the same
  time, so `control` should be the actual reference group.
- The
  [`ahsw_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/ahsw_fast.md)
  documentation states the actual condition for `NA` results (no events
  up to `tau` in a group).
- The
  [`analysis_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/analysis_fast.md)
  documentation no longer lists a `look.type` column, which the function
  does not return.

## FastSurvival 0.2.0

CRAN release: 2026-07-27

- New estimation and testing functions:
  - [`rmst_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/rmst_fast.md):
    restricted mean survival time for a single group or a two-group
    comparison (difference and ratio contrasts), integrating the
    Kaplan-Meier survival step function in a single C++ scan.
  - [`wmst_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/wmst_fast.md):
    window mean survival time over an interval, generalizing
    [`rmst_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/rmst_fast.md)
    (which is the special case with a lower window limit of zero), for a
    single group or a two-group difference, computed in the same single
    C++ scan with a Greenwood-type variance in which each event time
    contributes its squared remaining window area.
  - [`milestone_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/milestone_fast.md):
    two-group comparison of Kaplan-Meier survival at a milestone
    timepoint, with Wald, log-log, and MOVER inference methods.
  - [`medsurv_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/medsurv_fast.md):
    median survival time for a single group or a two-group difference,
    with a native kernel-hazard variance method and an `nph`-compatible
    local-constant-hazard method that reproduces the median comparison
    of the `nph` package to numerical precision; the point estimate is
    the same under both methods.
  - [`maxcombo_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/maxcombo_fast.md):
    max-combo test over a set of Fleming-Harrington weighted log-rank
    statistics, with the joint p-value obtained from the implied
    multivariate normal distribution.
  - [`rmw_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/rmw_fast.md):
    robust modestly-weighted log-rank test of Magirr and Öhrn, the
    maximum of the standard log-rank and a modestly-weighted log-rank
    statistic, with the joint p-value obtained from the implied
    bivariate normal distribution.
  - [`wkm_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/wkm_fast.md):
    weighted Kaplan-Meier (Pepe-Fleming) test, the weighted integrated
    difference between two Kaplan-Meier curves, with Pepe-Fleming,
    square-root, and constant weights, reproducing the weighted
    Kaplan-Meier statistic of the `nphsim` package.
  - [`ahsw_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/ahsw_fast.md):
    average hazard with survival weight of Uno and Horiguchi, reporting
    the ratio (RAH) and difference (DAH) contrasts.
  - [`ahr_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/ahr_fast.md):
    Kalbfleisch-Prentice average hazard ratio between two groups over a
    restricted interval, the estimator used by Dormuth et al. (2024) for
    sample-size calculation under non-proportional hazards, with a test
    on the group-share scale and an equivalent test and confidence
    interval on the log scale.
- [`survdiff_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/survdiff_fast.md)
  gains weighted log-rank tests (Fleming-Harrington, modestly-weighted,
  Gehan-Breslow, Tarone-Ware) and stratified and stratified-weighted
  variants, all sharing the single-scan C++ backend.
- New simulation layer:
  - [`simdata_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/simdata_fast.md)
    extended with optional subgroups defined by a prevalence
    specification and a flexible accrual specification: `a.rate` gives
    absolute accrual rates (with the end of an open final interval
    solved from the total when a trailing rate is supplied) and `a.prop`
    gives accrual proportions, with deterministic per-interval accrual
    counts. The entire generation pipeline runs in a single C++ kernel
    that materializes the output data frame once. It can also generate
    two correlated time-to-event endpoints (for example progression-free
    and overall survival) from an illness-death model with three
    transition hazards and optional treatment switching, reducing to the
    Fleischer maximal-independence model when the post-event hazard
    equals the direct terminal hazard. A vector `n` of length greater
    than two together with a per-arm survival list generates a multi-arm
    trial, each arm produced with the single-group kernel over a common
    accrual window and labeled 1 to `length(n)`, for analysis as
    pairwise contrasts against a shared control.
  - [`analysis_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/analysis_fast.md):
    interim or sequential analysis of simulated data at one or more
    looks, defined by target event counts or calendar times, computed by
    a fused C++ kernel that reuses the analysis cores of the standalone
    functions. Supports subgroup analyses.
  - [`pairwise_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/pairwise_fast.md):
    runs
    [`analysis_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/analysis_fast.md)
    for each experimental arm against a shared control on multi-arm
    data, at either fixed calendar looks or the per-simulation cutoffs
    of a designated primary contrast, and stacks the results with an
    optional Bonferroni adjustment across contrasts.
  - [`simsummary_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/simsummary_fast.md):
    operating-characteristic summary (rejection and futility rates,
    stopping-look distribution, expected timing) from
    [`analysis_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/analysis_fast.md)
    output and supplied group-sequential boundaries, with a
    [`print()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/print.html) method that lays the
    results out as a group-sequential design report.
- New visualization layer:
  - [`gen_scenario_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/gen_scenario_fast.md):
    assembles one or more two-group scenarios into a `scenario_fast`
    object for design-stage exploration, with a
    [`plot()`](https://rdrr.io/r/graphics/plot.default.html) method that
    draws the analytic survival curves and the piecewise hazard ratio of
    each scenario and a [`print()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/print.html)
    method that summarizes the medians, the start and end hazard ratios,
    and whether the curves cross.
  - [`kmcurve_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/kmcurve_fast.md):
    builds the Kaplan-Meier curves of a single trial realization (for
    example one replicate of
    [`simdata_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/simdata_fast.md))
    into a `kmcurve_fast` object, with a
    [`plot()`](https://rdrr.io/r/graphics/plot.default.html) method that
    draws the curves with optional restricted-mean shading and a
    smoothed time-varying hazard-ratio panel, and a
    [`print()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/print.html) method that
    summarizes the events and medians.
- Each estimation and testing function has a corresponding
  [`print()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/print.html) method, and the print
  methods share a unified display format.
- New vignettes accompany the analysis, simulation, and visualization
  layers: validation against established packages, a speed comparison, a
  group-sequential design reproduction, a log-rank versus RMST
  comparison under nonproportional hazards, the Freidlin-Korn
  strong-null investigation, a correlated PFS and OS group-sequential
  design under the Fleischer model, a multiregional regional-consistency
  evaluation, and a multi-arm design analyzed as pairwise contrasts
  against a shared control.

## FastSurvival 0.1.0

CRAN release: 2026-05-27

- Initial release.
- Core computations implemented in `C++` via `Rcpp` for use inside large
  simulation loops.
- [`survfit_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/survfit_fast.md):
  single-time-point Kaplan-Meier estimator with Greenwood standard error
  and plain / log / log-log confidence intervals. The C++ backend
  locates the evaluation cutoff via binary search and accumulates the
  Kaplan-Meier product and Greenwood variance sum in a single scan over
  event positions. Returns an object of class `"survfit_fast"` with a
  [`print()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/print.html) method.
- [`survdiff_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/survdiff_fast.md):
  log-rank test returning a one-sided Z-score or a two-sided chi-square
  statistic. The C++ backend uses a two-pointer merge scan over pooled
  sorted vectors, eliminating the rank construction,
  [`tabulate()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/tabulate.html), and reverse
  cumulative sum operations of the standard implementation. Returns an
  object of class `"survdiff_fast"` with a
  [`print()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/print.html) method.
- [`coxph_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/coxph_fast.md):
  closed-form hazard ratio estimator via the Pike-Halley Estimator
  method with Wald confidence interval. The C++ backend performs group
  splitting, at-risk counting, and per-distinct-event-time accumulation
  in a single pass. Returns an object of class `"coxph_fast"` with a
  [`print()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/print.html) method.
- [`simdata_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/simdata_fast.md):
  clinical trial data simulator supporting one- and two-group designs,
  piecewise uniform accrual, and simple and piecewise exponential
  survival and dropout times. C++ backends handle piecewise sampling and
  two-group interleaving, and random number generation uses `dqrng`.

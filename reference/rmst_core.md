# Core restricted mean survival time computation (C++ backend)

Internal C++ function that computes the restricted mean survival time
(RMST) and its Greenwood-type variance for a single group up to a
horizon `tau`. A single left-to-right scan over the sorted data
accumulates the Kaplan-Meier product and the area under the survival
step function, storing one summary per distinct event time (the
cumulative area to the left of that time and the Greenwood increment). A
second short pass over the saved summaries forms the variance as a sum
of squared right-side areas weighted by the Greenwood increments.
Accepts the event vector as a numeric (double) vector to avoid an
[`as.integer()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/integer.html) copy in R. Not
intended to be called directly by users; use
[`rmst_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/rmst_fast.md)
instead.

## Usage

``` r
rmst_core(t_sorted, e_sorted, tau)
```

## Arguments

- t_sorted:

  A numeric vector of follow-up times sorted in ascending order.

- e_sorted:

  A numeric vector of event indicators (1 = event, 0 = censored),
  aligned with `t_sorted`. Accepted as numeric to avoid an
  integer-conversion copy on the R side.

- tau:

  A single numeric value specifying the restriction horizon.

## Value

A numeric vector of length 2: `c(rmst, var_rmst)`, where `rmst` is the
restricted mean survival time and `var_rmst` is its variance, so that
SE\[RMST\] = sqrt(var_rmst). Returns `c(tau, 0.0)` when no events occur
up to `tau`.

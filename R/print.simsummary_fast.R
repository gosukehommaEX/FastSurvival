#' Print Method for Sequential Analysis Summaries
#'
#' @description
#' Formats an object returned by \code{\link{simsummary_fast}} in the style of a
#' group-sequential design report. After a header with the simulation count and
#' the boundary settings, two look-by-look tables are shown: a stopping-boundary
#' table (information fraction, events, sample size, the efficacy and futility
#' boundaries, and the cumulative efficacy crossing probability) and an
#' analysis-timing table (sample size, events, dropouts, pipeline, analysis time,
#' and the per-look efficacy and futility crossing probabilities). An overall
#' block reports the rejection rate and the expected counts and timing at the
#' stopping look.
#'
#' @details
#' Column labels follow the convention of group-sequential design software:
#' \code{Events (s)}, \code{Sample (n)}, \code{Dropouts (d)}, \code{Pipeline}
#' (the enrolled count minus events minus dropouts), \code{Analysis Time} (mean
#' calendar time), and \code{Info. Frac.} (the information fraction, computed as
#' the mean events at a look divided by the mean events at the final look, or
#' from \code{look.value} when no event count is available). Probabilities are
#' printed to \code{digits} decimal places and counts and times to fewer. Because
#' the summary is a Monte Carlo estimate under a single data-generating truth, it
#' does not carry the separate null and alternative columns or the alpha and beta
#' spending of an analytic design report. When the summary has several blocks
#' (arms of \code{\link{pairwise_fast}} output or subgroup populations), each
#' block is printed under its own heading. The object is a data frame with an
#' additional class, so the unrounded values remain available by subsetting
#' it. A selection of rows that keeps, in every block, all the looks in their
#' original order (for example one population or one arm) is printed as a
#' report. Any other selection of rows, such as some of the looks or rows in a
#' different order, is printed as an ordinary data frame, because the
#' boundaries and the information fractions refer to all the looks of the
#' design. A selection of columns keeps the class but not the boundary
#' settings, and is printed as an ordinary data frame, as is a selection
#' without any look row. Results combined by \code{rbind()} keep the attributes
#' of the first result only, which include a copy of its rows. The report is
#' therefore printed only when the rows of every block are those of the first
#' result; rows from another result, such as a population summarized with
#' other boundaries, make the whole object print as an ordinary data frame,
#' even when the block has the same name in both results.
#'
#' @param x An object of class \code{"simsummary_fast"} from
#'   \code{\link{simsummary_fast}}.
#' @param digits A single positive integer, the number of decimal places used for
#'   the printed probabilities. Defaults to 4.
#' @param ... Further arguments, currently ignored.
#'
#' @return The object \code{x}, invisibly.
#'
#' @seealso \code{\link{simsummary_fast}}.

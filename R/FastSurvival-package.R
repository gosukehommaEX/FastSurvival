#' FastSurvival: Fast Survival Analysis Functions for Simulation Studies
#'
#' @description
#' FastSurvival provides fast alternatives to the standard survival analysis
#' functions in the \pkg{survival} package. Every function is designed for
#' repeated evaluation inside large simulation loops, such as adaptive
#' sample-size re-estimation, probability-of-success calculations, and
#' regional consistency evaluation in multi-regional clinical trials. Core
#' computations are implemented in C++ via \pkg{Rcpp} for maximum performance
#' inside simulation loops.
#'
#' @details
#' The package exports four functions. The three analysis functions return
#' S3-class objects (\code{"survfit_fast"}, \code{"survdiff_fast"},
#' \code{"coxph_fast"}) with \code{print()} methods that format the results
#' similarly to the corresponding \pkg{survival} package output. Each object
#' is internally a numeric vector, so it can be used directly in arithmetic,
#' subsetting, and aggregation after stripping the class with
#' \code{\link[base]{unclass}}.
#'
#' \describe{
#'   \item{\code{\link{survfit_fast}}}{Kaplan-Meier survival probability,
#'     standard error, and confidence interval at a single specified time
#'     point. The C++ backend locates the evaluation cutoff via binary search
#'     and accumulates the Kaplan-Meier product and Greenwood sum in a single
#'     scan over event positions only, without constructing intermediate
#'     vectors, making it approximately 50 times faster than \code{survfit()}
#'     plus \code{summary()} for repeated single-time-point evaluations.}
#'   \item{\code{\link{survdiff_fast}}}{Log-rank test statistic (one-sided
#'     Z-score or two-sided chi-square) for two-group survival data. The C++
#'     backend uses a two-pointer merge scan over pooled sorted vectors,
#'     eliminating the \code{rank()}, \code{tabulate()}, and
#'     \code{rev(cumsum(rev(...)))} overhead of the standard implementation,
#'     making it approximately 40 times faster than \code{survdiff()}.}
#'   \item{\code{\link{coxph_fast}}}{Closed-form hazard ratio estimator
#'     via the Pike-Halley Estimator method, with Wald confidence interval.
#'     The Pike-Halley Estimator anchors at the Pike estimate and applies a
#'     single analytic Halley correction to the Cox partial likelihood score,
#'     achieving residual error of order O_p(n^\{-3/2\}) relative to the
#'     Cox maximum likelihood estimate. The C++ backend performs group
#'     splitting, at-risk counting, and per-distinct-event-time accumulation
#'     in a single pass, making it approximately 30 times faster than
#'     \code{coxph()}.}
#'   \item{\code{\link{simdata_fast}}}{Clinical trial data simulator for
#'     one- and two-group time-to-event trials. Supports piecewise uniform
#'     accrual, simple and piecewise exponential survival and dropout times.
#'     C++ backends handle piecewise sampling and two-group interleaving,
#'     and random number generation uses \pkg{dqrng}, making it
#'     approximately 4 times faster than an equivalent pure-R
#'     implementation.}

#' Fast Simulation of Two-Group Time-to-Event Trial Data
#'
#' @description
#' Simulates time-to-event trial data for one or two groups across many
#' simulated trials, with piecewise accrual, piecewise-exponential survival and
#' dropout, and optional subgroups defined by a prevalence specification. The
#' entire generation pipeline (accrual, survival, dropout, derived columns, and
#' two-group interleaving) runs in a single C++ kernel that materializes the
#' output data frame once, avoiding intermediate R-level vector operations and
#' copies. The random-number stream is consumed in the same order as a per-group
#' reference implementation, so results are reproducible from \code{seed}.
#'
#' @details
#' For each subject the observed time-to-event is
#' \code{tte = pmin(surv_time, dropout_time)} and \code{event} is 1 when the
#' survival time occurs first. The calendar time of the observed event is
#' \code{accrual_time + tte}.
#'
#' A hazard of zero in the last piece (for example a cure fraction, as in
#' \code{e.hazard = c(0.1, 0)} with \code{e.time = c(0, 24, Inf)}) gives an
#' infinite latent time to some subjects. A subject with neither a finite
#' survival time nor a finite dropout time has \code{tte = Inf} and
#' \code{event = 0}, and an analysis at a finite cutoff censors the subject at
#' the cutoff.
#'
#' The total enrolled is fixed at \code{sum(n)}. With \code{a.rate} the rates are
#' absolute (subjects per unit time): when the accrual period is fully specified
#' the rates must accrue exactly \code{sum(n)}, and when one extra rate is given
#' the end of the final interval is solved so the total is met. With \code{a.prop}
#' the values are relative proportions that distribute \code{sum(n)} across the
#' fully specified intervals. Each accrual interval receives a deterministic
#' number of subjects (the rate or proportion times the group total, rounded to
#' keep the per-group total exact), placed uniformly within the interval.
#'
#' Survival and dropout are exponential when a single hazard (or median) is
#' supplied and piecewise-exponential when a vector is supplied together with
#' the corresponding \code{e.time} or \code{d.time} breakpoints, whose last
#' element must be \code{Inf}. Group-specific parameters are supplied as a
#' two-element list (control first, treatment second).
#'
#' When \code{prevalence} is supplied the trial has subgroups. A numeric vector
#' defines a single factor; a list of numeric vectors defines several
#' independent factors; a multi-dimensional array defines the joint
#' distribution of correlated factors. Per-cell hazards may be supplied as a
#' list with one element per cell (cells in column-major order, the first
#' factor varying fastest). With \code{fixed.alloc = TRUE} the subgroup
#' sizes are deterministic and the fixed labels are assigned to subjects in a
#' random order within each simulated trial, so subgroup membership does not
#' depend on the accrual time; otherwise subgroup membership is drawn from the
#' prevalence distribution.
#'
#' The number of groups is determined as follows. A length-two \code{n} always
#' gives two groups. A scalar \code{n} gives two groups, with the total split
#' by \code{alloc}, in any of these cases: \code{alloc} is supplied explicitly;
#' the prevalence is group-specific; without subgroups, any of \code{e.hazard},
#' \code{e.median}, \code{d.hazard}, and \code{d.median} is a list; with
#' subgroups, one of them is a length-two list with a list element (per-cell
#' values within a group, as in \code{list(list(0.10, 0.08, 0.06), 0.05)}).
#' Otherwise a scalar \code{n} gives one group, and with subgroups a list is
#' read as one element per cell of that group. So with subgroups and a scalar
#' \code{n}, \code{e.hazard = list(0.10, 0.05)} means per-cell hazards of a
#' single group unless \code{alloc} is supplied, in which case it means
#' per-group hazards. In a two-group simulation each specification is either
#' shared by both groups (not a list) or a list of length two (control first),
#' and each group's element may be a per-cell list when there are subgroups.
#' Without subgroups, a length-two \code{n} requires at least one of the
#' survival and dropout specifications to be such a list.
#' The breakpoints \code{e.time} and \code{d.time} follow the same structure
#' (per group in a two-group simulation, per cell in a one-group simulation with
#' subgroups).
#'
#' When \code{n} is a vector of length greater than two together with a per-arm
#' survival list, the simulation is a multi-arm trial. Each arm is generated in
#' turn with the validated single-group kernel over a common accrual window, and
#' the arms are stacked into one data frame with a \code{group} column labeled 1
#' to \code{length(n)} in the order of \code{n}. Per-arm survival is supplied as
#' an \code{e.hazard} or \code{e.median} list with one element per arm, and
#' optional dropout as a shared value or a per-arm list through \code{d.hazard}
#' or \code{d.median}. The arms share the master \code{seed}, so the result is
#' reproducible. A multi-arm design is analyzed as a set of pairwise contrasts by
#' subsetting the output to the control arm and one other arm and calling
#' \code{\link{analysis_fast}} once per contrast, which
#' \code{\link{pairwise_fast}} does for every experimental arm. Multi-arm mode does not support
#' subgroups or the illness-death model, which remain two-group.
#'
#' The illness-death model (activated by \code{h01.*} or \code{h02.*}) also
#' accepts \code{prevalence} and \code{fixed.alloc}. The transition hazards
#' (\code{h01.*}, \code{h02.*}, \code{h12.*}, \code{h12.switch.*}),
#' \code{switch.prop}, and the dropout specification then follow the rules of
#' \code{e.hazard} with subgroups: in a two-group simulation each is shared or
#' a list with one element per group, and each group's element is shared or a
#' list with one element per subgroup cell, for example
#' \code{h01.hazard = list(list(0.10, 0.06), 0.05)}; with a scalar \code{n}
#' and no \code{alloc}, a list without list elements holds one element per
#' cell of a single group. All subjects share one accrual process and the
#' subgroup cells are assigned after accrual, so the subgroups enroll over the
#' same calendar in proportion to their prevalence. This gives a mixture of
#' illness-death models without generating the subgroups separately and
#' adjusting their accrual rates. With a single cell (for example
#' \code{prevalence = 1}) the data equal those without \code{prevalence}, with
#' the subgroup column added.
#'
#' @param nsim Number of simulated trials.
#' @param n Either a single total sample size (split by \code{alloc}), a
#'   length-two vector of per-group sample sizes, or, for a multi-arm trial, a
#'   vector of length greater than two giving the per-arm sample sizes (which
#'   requires a per-arm \code{e.hazard} or \code{e.median} list). When \code{n}
#'   is a per-arm vector, \code{alloc} is ignored.
#' @param alloc A length-two allocation ratio (control, treatment), used when
#'   \code{n} is scalar. Supplying it explicitly requests a two-group
#'   simulation (see Details). The total is split in proportion to \code{alloc} and any rounding
#'   remainder goes to the group with the larger fractional share, so the two
#'   group sizes always add up to \code{n}.
#' @param a.time A numeric vector of accrual-interval breakpoints.
#' @param a.rate Absolute accrual rates (subjects per unit time), interpreted in
#'   one of two ways. With length \code{length(a.time) - 1} the accrual period is
#'   fully specified and the rates must accrue exactly \code{sum(n)} subjects (an
#'   inconsistent total is an error). With length \code{length(a.time)} the final
#'   rate applies to an open last interval whose end time is computed so the
#'   total is \code{sum(n)}. Supply exactly one of \code{a.rate} and \code{a.prop}.
#' @param a.prop Accrual proportions, one per accrual interval (length
#'   \code{length(a.time) - 1}), giving the fraction of subjects enrolled in each
#'   interval. Values are normalized to sum to one and distribute the fixed total
#'   \code{sum(n)}. Unlike \code{a.rate} this carries no rate, so the accrual
#'   period must be fully specified by \code{a.time}. Supply exactly one of
#'   \code{a.rate} and \code{a.prop}.
#' @param e.hazard Survival hazard(s). A scalar or vector (piecewise, with
#'   \code{e.time}) shared by all groups and cells, a two-element list for two
#'   groups, or, with subgroups, a per-cell list (for one group, or as an
#'   element of the two-element list). See Details for how the number of
#'   groups is determined.
#' @param e.median Survival median(s); an alternative to \code{e.hazard}.
#' @param e.time Survival breakpoints for piecewise hazards (last element
#'   \code{Inf}).
#' @param d.hazard Dropout hazard(s), same structure as \code{e.hazard}.
#' @param d.median Dropout median(s); an alternative to \code{d.hazard}.
#' @param d.time Dropout breakpoints for piecewise hazards.
#' @param seed Optional integer seed for the \code{dqrng} generator. If
#'   \code{NULL} (default), the data are drawn from the current state of that
#'   generator, which \code{set.seed()} does not control: the state is
#'   initialized from R's random-number generator when \code{dqrng} is
#'   loaded, so repeated calls give different data, and processes forked from
#'   one R session (for example by \code{parallel::mclapply()}) start from the
#'   same state. Supply \code{seed} (and \code{stream} for parallel batches)
#'   for reproducible data.
#' @param stream Optional non-negative whole number selecting an independent
#'   \code{dqrng} random-number stream for the given \code{seed}; requires
#'   \code{seed}. A large simulation can be split into batches that are
#'   generated with the same \code{seed} and \code{stream = 1, 2, ...},
#'   sequentially or in parallel, and the result of each batch does not depend
#'   on how the batches are distributed. With the default Xoroshiro128++
#'   generator of \code{dqrng}, stream \code{k} starts \code{k} jumps of
#'   \eqn{2^{64}} draws ahead of the seeded state, so \code{stream = 0} gives
#'   the same numbers as no stream. See the section on batches.
#' @param prevalence Optional subgroup prevalence specification (numeric
#'   vector, list of vectors, array, or a named \code{control}/\code{treatment}
#'   list for group-specific prevalence), for the single-endpoint and the
#'   illness-death models.
#' @param fixed.alloc Logical; when \code{TRUE} subgroup sizes are
#'   deterministic rather than drawn. In a group of \code{n} subjects, each
#'   cell with probability \code{p} receives \code{floor(n * p)} subjects, and
#'   the remaining subjects are added one at a time to the cells in order,
#'   starting from the first cell.
#' @param h01.hazard Transition hazard(s) for the non-terminal (intermediate)
#'   event (state 0 to state 1) in the illness-death model. A scalar or vector
#'   for one group, or a two-element list for two groups. Supplying any of
#'   \code{h01.*} or \code{h02.*} activates the illness-death model with two
#'   correlated endpoints, and is mutually exclusive with \code{e.hazard} /
#'   \code{e.median}.
#' @param h01.median Median(s) for the intermediate event; an alternative to
#'   \code{h01.hazard}.
#' @param h01.time Breakpoints for a piecewise \code{h01.hazard} (last element
#'   \code{Inf}).
#' @param h02.hazard Transition hazard(s) for the terminal event without a prior
#'   intermediate event (state 0 to state 2). Same group and piecewise
#'   conventions as \code{h01.hazard}.
#' @param h02.median Median(s) for the direct terminal event; an alternative to
#'   \code{h02.hazard}.
#' @param h02.time Breakpoints for a piecewise \code{h02.hazard}.
#' @param h12.hazard Transition hazard(s) for the terminal event after an
#'   intermediate event (state 1 to state 2) for subjects who do not switch.
#'   Defaults to \code{h02.hazard}, which gives the maximal-independence model
#'   of Fleischer, Gaschler-Markefski, and Bluhmki (2009): with constant
#'   hazards and no switching, the time to the intermediate event and the time
#'   to the terminal event are independent exponential variables, and their
#'   Theorem 1 gives the correlation of the two endpoints (PFS and OS) as the
#'   ratio of their medians. A different constant \code{h12.hazard} gives their
#'   more general model. With a piecewise \code{h02.hazard} the clock-reset
#'   \code{h12} restarts the piecewise profile at the intermediate event.
#' @param h12.median Median(s) for the post-event terminal event; an alternative
#'   to \code{h12.hazard}.
#' @param h12.time Breakpoints for a piecewise \code{h12.hazard}, measured from
#'   the intermediate-event time (clock-reset).
#' @param switch.prop Probability that a subject whose intermediate event is
#'   observed (on or before dropout) switches treatment at that event, a
#'   scalar or a two-element list (control, treatment).
#'   Defaults to zero (no switching); the treatment group is typically left at
#'   zero.
#' @param h12.switch.hazard Transition hazard(s) from state 1 to state 2 for
#'   subjects who switch. Required when any \code{switch.prop} is positive.
#' @param h12.switch.median Median(s) for the post-switch terminal event; an
#'   alternative to \code{h12.switch.hazard}.
#' @param h12.switch.time Breakpoints for a piecewise \code{h12.switch.hazard},
#'   measured from the switch (intermediate-event) time (clock-reset).
#' @param switch.clock Time origin for the post-event hazards. Currently only
#'   \code{"reset"} (measured from the intermediate event) is implemented.
#'
#' @section Batches and parallel execution:
#' The output has \code{nsim * sum(n)} rows, so memory rather than time limits
#' the number of simulated trials in one call. A large study can be run in
#' batches: each batch is generated with the same \code{seed} and its own
#' \code{stream}, analyzed with \code{\link{analysis_fast}}, and only the
#' analysis results are kept. Because each stream is an independent sequence of
#' the \code{dqrng} generator, the data of batch \code{b} are the same whether
#' the batches are run one after another or distributed over parallel workers
#' (for example with \code{parallel::mclapply()} or the future framework), and
#' whatever the number of workers. The simulation identifiers start at 1 in
#' every batch, so they are renumbered before the batch results are combined.
#' Functions that draw further random numbers, such as \code{\link{switch_fast}},
#' continue the same stream within a batch. The max-combo p-values of
#' \code{\link{analysis_fast}} with four or more weights (or a two-sided test)
#' are computed with R's own random-number generator, so a batch should also
#' call \code{set.seed()} before the analysis for p-values that are identical
#' across runs.
#'
#' @return A \code{data.frame} with \code{nsim * sum(n)} rows. The columns are
#'   \code{sim}, \code{group}, any subgroup columns, \code{accrual_time},
#'   \code{surv_time}, \code{dropout_time}, \code{tte}, \code{event}, and
#'   \code{calendar_time}.
#'   In the illness-death model the columns are instead \code{sim},
#'   \code{group}, any subgroup columns, \code{accrual_time},
#'   \code{e1_surv_time},
#'   \code{e2_surv_time}, \code{dropout_time}, \code{e1_tte}, \code{e1_event},
#'   \code{e2_tte}, \code{e2_event}, \code{e1_calendar_time},
#'   \code{e2_calendar_time}, \code{intermediate}, \code{switched}, and
#'   \code{switch_time}, where \code{e1} is the first (state-0 exit) endpoint
#'   and \code{e2} is the terminal endpoint. In oncology \code{e1} is
#'   progression-free survival, \code{e2} is overall survival, and
#'   \code{intermediate} flags progression. The column \code{intermediate}
#'   describes the latent process (an intermediate event before the terminal
#'   event, \code{e1_surv_time < e2_surv_time}), also when it would occur
#'   after dropout; the observed intermediate event is \code{intermediate == 1}
#'   with \code{e1_event == 1}. A switch (\code{switched == 1}, at
#'   \code{switch_time}, the intermediate-event time) occurs only after an
#'   observed intermediate event.

# Validation of FastSurvival

## Purpose

FastSurvival is built for speed, but a fast estimator is only useful if
it returns the same answer as the established implementation. This
vignette checks the numerical agreement between each FastSurvival
function and a reference, on a real clinical-trial dataset. We use the
`gbsg` data from the survival package, the German Breast Cancer Study
Group cohort of 686 patients, with recurrence-free survival time
`rfstime` (in days), the event indicator `status`, and the treatment
indicator `hormon` (0 = no hormonal therapy, 1 = hormonal therapy).
Throughout we take the no-hormone arm as the control (`control = 0`) and
report one-sided tests of treatment benefit (`side = 1`).

The references are: the survival package for the Kaplan-Meier estimate,
the log-rank test, the Cox hazard ratio, milestone survival, and the
median survival comparison; survRM2 for the restricted mean survival
time; survAH for the average hazard with survival weight; nph for the
weighted log-rank test and the max-combo test; and nphRCT for the robust
modestly-weighted test. The window mean survival time and the weighted
Kaplan-Meier statistic, which have no direct package counterpart on
CRAN, are checked against a Kaplan-Meier integral computed from
[`survfit()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/survival/man/survfit.html) and against
the restricted mean survival time identity, respectively. The same
comparisons form the basis of the automated test suite shipped with the
package.

``` r

library(FastSurvival)
```

## Reference data

``` r

library(survival)

# German Breast Cancer Study Group cohort
str(gbsg[, c("rfstime", "status", "hormon")])
#> 'data.frame':    686 obs. of  3 variables:
#>  $ rfstime: int  1838 403 1603 177 1855 842 293 42 564 1093 ...
#>  $ status : int  0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 ...
#>  $ hormon : int  0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 ...
table(hormon = gbsg$hormon)
#> hormon
#>   0   1 
#> 440 246
```

## Kaplan-Meier survival

[`survfit_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/survfit_fast.md)
evaluates the Kaplan-Meier estimate at a single time point. We compare
against `summary(survfit(...))` at the same time (1000 days).

``` r

# survfit_fast assumes time-sorted input; the C++ core groups tied times in the
# survival::survfit risk-set convention, so the data only need ordering by time.
ord  <- order(gbsg$rfstime)
fast <- survfit_fast(gbsg$rfstime[ord], gbsg$status[ord],
                     t_eval = 1000, conf.type = "log-log")

fit  <- survfit(Surv(rfstime, status) ~ 1, data = gbsg)
ref  <- summary(fit, times = 1000)

data.frame(
  quantity = c("survival", "std.err"),
  fast     = c(unclass(fast)["surv"], unclass(fast)["std.err"]),
  survival = c(ref$surv, ref$std.err),
  row.names = NULL
)
#>   quantity       fast   survival
#> 1 survival 0.65775040 0.65775040
#> 2  std.err 0.01905146 0.01905146
```

## Log-rank test

[`survdiff_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/survdiff_fast.md)
with `side = 1` returns a signed Z-score. Its square is the chi-square
statistic from
[`survdiff()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/survival/man/survdiff.html).

``` r

fast_lr <- survdiff_fast(gbsg$rfstime, gbsg$status, gbsg$hormon,
                         control = 0, side = 1)

ref_lr  <- survdiff(Surv(rfstime, status) ~ hormon, data = gbsg)

c(fast = as.numeric(fast_lr)^2, survival = ref_lr$chisq)
#>     fast survival 
#> 8.564781 8.564781
```

## Weighted log-rank test

[`survdiff_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/survdiff_fast.md)
also computes Fleming-Harrington G(rho, gamma) weighted log-rank tests
through the `weight = "fh"` argument. The
[nph](https://cran.r-project.org/package=nph) package provides
`logrank.test()` with the same family, so we compare the chi-square
statistic (the squared one-sided Z) across several weight choices.

``` r

fh_grid <- data.frame(rho = c(0, 1, 0, 1), gamma = c(1, 0, 0, 1))

do.call(rbind, lapply(seq_len(nrow(fh_grid)), function(i) {
  r <- fh_grid$rho[i]
  g <- fh_grid$gamma[i]
  fast <- as.numeric(survdiff_fast(gbsg$rfstime, gbsg$status, gbsg$hormon,
                                   control = 0, side = 1,
                                   weight = "fh", rho = r, gamma = g))
  nph_chisq <- nph::logrank.test(gbsg$rfstime, gbsg$status, gbsg$hormon,
                                 rho = r, gamma = g)$test$Chisq
  data.frame(rho = r, gamma = g, fast = fast^2, nph = nph_chisq)
}))
#>   rho gamma     fast      nph
#> 1   0     1 5.110660 5.110660
#> 2   1     0 8.713791 8.713791
#> 3   0     0 8.564781 8.564781
#> 4   1     1 5.881310 5.881310
```

The two implementations agree to numerical precision across the weight
family, including the ordinary log-rank test recovered at
`rho = 0, gamma = 0`.

## Cox hazard ratio

[`coxph_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/coxph_fast.md)
returns the Pike-Halley Estimator, a closed-form approximation to the
Cox partial likelihood maximizer. We report the log hazard ratio from
both; the sign convention is the same and `side` does not affect the
point estimate.

``` r

fast_hr <- coxph_fast(gbsg$rfstime, gbsg$status, gbsg$hormon,
                      control = 0, side = 1)

ref_cox <- coxph(Surv(rfstime, status) ~ hormon, data = gbsg)

c(fast = unclass(fast_hr)["coef"], cox = unname(coef(ref_cox)))
#>  fast.coef        cox 
#> -0.3638987 -0.3640099
```

Because the Pike-Halley Estimator is a closed-form approximation rather
than the exact partial-likelihood maximizer, the two log hazard ratios
are not expected to be identical. They differ slightly, here in the
fourth decimal place, which reflects the approximation and is not a sign
of error.

## Restricted mean survival time

[`rmst_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/rmst_fast.md)
integrates the Kaplan-Meier survival curve up to a horizon. We compare
the two-group RMST difference against
[`survRM2::rmst2()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/survRM2/man/rmst2.html) at 1000
days.

``` r

library(survRM2)

tau <- 1000

fast_rmst <- rmst_fast(gbsg$rfstime, gbsg$status, gbsg$hormon,
                       control = 0, tau = tau, side = 1)

ref_rmst  <- rmst2(time = gbsg$rfstime, status = gbsg$status,
                   arm = gbsg$hormon, tau = tau)

c(fast = unclass(fast_rmst)["diff"],
  survRM2 = ref_rmst$unadjusted.result[1, 1])
#> fast.diff   survRM2 
#>  51.14447  51.14447
```

## Window mean survival time

[`wmst_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/wmst_fast.md)
integrates the Kaplan-Meier curve between a lower and an upper window
limit, generalizing the restricted mean survival time. CRAN has no
dedicated WMST package, so we validate the per-group windowed area
directly against a Kaplan-Meier step-function integral computed from
[`survfit()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/survival/man/survfit.html) over the
same window. A full comparison against the `survWMST` package, which is
distributed on GitHub, is provided in `tools/compare_wmst_survwmst.R`.

``` r

tau1 <- 200
tau2 <- 1000

fast_wm <- wmst_fast(gbsg$rfstime, gbsg$status, gbsg$hormon,
                     control = 0, side = 1, tau1 = tau1, tau2 = tau2)

# Integral of the Kaplan-Meier step function over [lo, hi] for one group.
km_window_area <- function(gi, lo, hi) {
  sf <- survfit(Surv(rfstime, status) ~ 1, data = gbsg[gbsg$hormon == gi, ])
  tk <- c(0, sf$time)
  sk <- c(1, sf$surv)
  brk  <- sort(unique(c(lo, hi, sf$time[sf$time > lo & sf$time < hi])))
  area <- 0
  for (b in seq_len(length(brk) - 1L)) {
    u  <- brk[b]
    su <- sk[max(which(tk <= u))]
    area <- area + su * (brk[b + 1L] - u)
  }
  area
}

data.frame(
  group    = c("control", "treatment"),
  fast     = unclass(fast_wm)[c("wmst.control", "wmst.treatment")],
  survfit  = c(km_window_area(0, tau1, tau2), km_window_area(1, tau1, tau2)),
  row.names = NULL
)
#>       group     fast  survfit
#> 1   control 628.0064 628.0064
#> 2 treatment 678.3393 678.3393
```

## Weighted Kaplan-Meier test

[`wkm_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/wkm_fast.md)
computes the weighted Kaplan-Meier (Pepe-Fleming) test, the weighted
integral of the difference between the two Kaplan-Meier curves. With the
constant weight the weighted difference reduces exactly to the
difference in restricted mean survival time over the observed range,
which gives a clean internal check against
[`rmst_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/rmst_fast.md)
evaluated at the largest observed time.

``` r

tmax <- max(gbsg$rfstime)

fast_wk <- wkm_fast(gbsg$rfstime, gbsg$status, gbsg$hormon,
                    control = 0, side = 1, weight = "constant")

ref_rm  <- rmst_fast(gbsg$rfstime, gbsg$status, gbsg$hormon,
                     control = 0, tau = tmax, side = 1)

c(wkm.constant = unclass(fast_wk)["wdiff"], rmst = unclass(ref_rm)["diff"])
#> wkm.constant.wdiff          rmst.diff 
#>           256.7207           256.7207
```

With the default Pepe-Fleming weight,
[`wkm_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/wkm_fast.md)
reproduces the weighted Kaplan-Meier statistic of the `nphsim` package.
Because `nphsim` is distributed only on GitHub, that comparison is kept
in `tools/compare_wkm_nphsim.R` (which also bundles a survival-only
reproduction of the statistic) and in the test suite, rather than in
this vignette.

## Milestone survival

[`milestone_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/milestone_fast.md)
compares Kaplan-Meier survival between two groups at a milestone
timepoint. The per-group survival probabilities match those from
[`survfit()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/survival/man/survfit.html).

``` r

tstar <- 1000

fast_ms <- milestone_fast(gbsg$rfstime, gbsg$status, gbsg$hormon,
                          control = 0, tau = tstar, method = "loglog",
                          side = 1)

fit_g <- survfit(Surv(rfstime, status) ~ hormon, data = gbsg)
ref_g <- summary(fit_g, times = tstar)

data.frame(
  group    = c("control", "treatment"),
  fast     = fast_ms$surv[c("control", "treatment")],
  survival = ref_g$surv,
  row.names = NULL
)
#>       group      fast  survival
#> 1   control 0.6208762 0.6208762
#> 2 treatment 0.7230082 0.7230082
```

## Median survival time

[`medsurv_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/medsurv_fast.md)
estimates the Kaplan-Meier median survival time and, for two groups,
their difference. The point estimate is the Kaplan-Meier median (the
first time at which the product-limit curve reaches 0.5), the same
convention as
[`survfit()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/survival/man/survfit.html), so the
per-group medians match those reported by
[`survfit()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/survival/man/survfit.html) exactly.

``` r

fast_med <- medsurv_fast(gbsg$rfstime, gbsg$status, gbsg$hormon,
                         control = 0, side = 1, method = "nph")

fit_med <- survfit(Surv(rfstime, status) ~ hormon, data = gbsg)
med_ref <- summary(fit_med)$table[, "median"]

data.frame(
  group    = c("control", "treatment"),
  fast     = unclass(fast_med)[c("median.control", "median.treatment")],
  survival = c(med_ref[1], med_ref[2]),
  row.names = NULL
)
#>       group fast survival
#> 1   control 1528     1528
#> 2 treatment 2018     2018
```

We use [`survfit()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/survival/man/survfit.html) as
the reference here, rather than
[`nph::nphparams()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/nph/man/nphparams.html),
because the two define the median on different survival curves:
[`survfit()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/survival/man/survfit.html) and
[`medsurv_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/medsurv_fast.md)
use the Kaplan-Meier (product-limit) median, whereas
[`nph::nphparams()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/nph/man/nphparams.html) reads
the median off the Nelson-Aalen curve, S(t) = exp(-H(t)), which lies
above the Kaplan-Meier curve and so can cross 0.5 at a later time on
tied data. The `method = "nph"` standard error reproduces the
[`nph::nphparams()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/nph/man/nphparams.html)
standard error to numerical precision when the two medians coincide;
that comparison is run on tie-free scenarios in
`tools/compare_medsurv_nphparams.R` and in the package test suite.

## Average hazard with survival weight

[`ahsw_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/ahsw_fast.md)
computes the average hazard with survival weight of Uno and Horiguchi.
We compare the per-group average hazard against
[`survAH::ah2()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/survAH/man/ah2.html).

``` r

library(survAH)

tau <- 1000

fast_ah <- ahsw_fast(gbsg$rfstime, gbsg$status, gbsg$hormon,
                     control = 0, tau = tau, side = 1)

ref_ah  <- ah2(time = gbsg$rfstime, status = gbsg$status,
               arm = gbsg$hormon, tau = tau)

data.frame(
  quantity = c("AH (control)", "AH (treatment)"),
  fast     = unclass(fast_ah)[c("ah.ctrl", "ah.trt")],
  survAH   = c(ref_ah$ah["AH (arm0)", "Est."],
               ref_ah$ah["AH (arm1)", "Est."]),
  row.names = NULL
)
#>         quantity         fast       survAH
#> 1   AH (control) 0.0004585857 0.0004585857
#> 2 AH (treatment) 0.0003155277 0.0003155277
```

The average hazard is the ratio of the cumulative event probability to
the restricted mean survival time, so for the `gbsg` data, where
follow-up is measured in days, the values are on the order of 1e-04 per
day in both groups.

## Average hazard ratio

[`ahr_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/ahr_fast.md)
computes the Kalbfleisch-Prentice average hazard ratio between two
groups over a restricted interval. The reference implementation is
`ahrKM()` from the AHR package, but that package has been archived on
CRAN, so here we check the point estimates against a direct
survival-based computation: each group’s Kaplan-Meier curve from
[`survfit()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/survival/man/survfit.html), integrated
to form the group shares of the total hazard.

``` r

tau <- 1000

fast_ahr <- ahr_fast(gbsg$rfstime, gbsg$status, gbsg$hormon,
                     control = 0, tau = tau, side = 1)

g  <- gbsg$hormon
ev <- c(gbsg$rfstime[g == 0 & gbsg$status == 1],
        gbsg$rfstime[g == 1 & gbsg$status == 1])
grid <- sort(unique(c(0, ev[ev <= tau], tau)))

km_on_grid <- function(gi) {
  sf <- survfit(Surv(rfstime, status) ~ 1, data = gbsg[g == gi, ])
  approxfun(sf$time, sf$surv, method = "constant",
            yleft = 1, rule = 2, f = 0)(grid)
}

S0  <- km_on_grid(0)
S1  <- km_on_grid(1)
m   <- length(grid)
dS0 <- S0 - c(1, S0[-m])
GL  <- S0[m] * S1[m]
ref_theta_ctrl <- -sum(S1 * dS0) / (1 - GL)

data.frame(
  quantity  = c("theta (control)", "theta (treatment)", "AHR"),
  fast      = c(fast_ahr$theta[[1]], fast_ahr$theta[[2]], fast_ahr$ahr),
  reference = c(ref_theta_ctrl, 1 - ref_theta_ctrl,
                (1 - ref_theta_ctrl) / ref_theta_ctrl),
  row.names = NULL
)
#>            quantity      fast reference
#> 1   theta (control) 0.5974108 0.5974108
#> 2 theta (treatment) 0.4025892 0.4025892
#> 3               AHR 0.6738899 0.6738899
```

The point estimates match the survival-based reference to numerical
precision. The average hazard ratio was additionally cross-checked
against the archived AHR package, the reference implementation used by
Dormuth et al. (2024): the two group shares, the average hazard ratio,
the variances, and both test statistics agree to within the order of
1e-15. That external comparison is reproducible with the
`tools/compare_ahr_ahrKM.R` script shipped in the package sources.

## Max-combo test

[`maxcombo_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/maxcombo_fast.md)
computes the max-combo test, the most extreme of a set of
Fleming-Harrington weighted log-rank statistics. The `nph` package
provides `logrank.maxtest()`, whose default weight set is FH(0, 0),
FH(0, 1), and FH(1, 0). We request the same three weights from
[`maxcombo_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/maxcombo_fast.md)
and compare the component Z-scores. The individual Z-scores are kept in
the `z` attribute, signed so that a negative value indicates benefit for
the treatment group under the package convention. Because `nph` orients
the contrast in the opposite direction, the signs are mirrored, so we
compare absolute values.

``` r

rho   <- c(0, 0, 1)
gamma <- c(0, 1, 0)

fast_mc <- maxcombo_fast(gbsg$rfstime, gbsg$status, gbsg$hormon,
                         control = 0, side = 1, rho = rho, gamma = gamma)

nph_mc <- nph::logrank.maxtest(gbsg$rfstime, gbsg$status, gbsg$hormon)

data.frame(
  weight = c("FH(0,0)", "FH(0,1)", "FH(1,0)"),
  fast   = abs(attr(fast_mc, "z")),
  nph    = abs(nph_mc$tests$z),
  row.names = NULL
)
#>    weight     fast      nph
#> 1 FH(0,0) 2.926565 2.926565
#> 2 FH(0,1) 2.260677 2.260677
#> 3 FH(1,0) 2.951913 2.951913
```

The component statistics agree in absolute value. The final max-combo
statistic is the largest of these, which for the one-sided test is the
most extreme component Z. The p-values from the two packages are close
but not identical, since they use different numerical methods for the
joint distribution (a multivariate normal integral here, a
Bonferroni-style combination in `nph`).

## Robust modestly-weighted log-rank test

[`rmw_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/rmw_fast.md)
computes the robust modestly-weighted (rMW) test of Magirr and Öhrn, the
maximum of the standard log-rank statistic and a single
modestly-weighted log-rank statistic. Each component is a weighted
log-rank test, so we check the two component Z-scores against
[nphRCT](https://cran.r-project.org/package=nphRCT), the implementation
used by the method’s authors. The modestly-weighted component uses the
survival-threshold parameterization, so `s_star = 1` recovers the
standard log-rank test and `s_star = 0.5` gives the modestly-weighted
component. As with the max-combo test the package orients a negative Z
toward treatment benefit while `nphRCT` uses the opposite sign, so we
compare absolute values.

``` r

gbsg_df <- data.frame(
  time  = gbsg$rfstime,
  event = gbsg$status,
  arm   = factor(ifelse(gbsg$hormon == 0, "control", "experimental"),
                 levels = c("control", "experimental"))
)

fit_rmw <- rmw_fast(gbsg_df$time, gbsg_df$event, gbsg_df$arm,
                    control = "control", side = 1, s_star = 0.5)

z_lr_nph <- nphRCT::wlrt(Surv(time, event) ~ arm, data = gbsg_df,
                         method = "mw", s_star = 1)$z
z_mw_nph <- nphRCT::wlrt(Surv(time, event) ~ arm, data = gbsg_df,
                         method = "mw", s_star = 0.5)$z

data.frame(
  component = c("log-rank (s_star = 1)", "modestly-weighted (s_star = 0.5)"),
  fast      = abs(attr(fit_rmw, "z")),
  nphRCT    = abs(c(z_lr_nph, z_mw_nph)),
  row.names = NULL
)
#>                          component     fast   nphRCT
#> 1            log-rank (s_star = 1) 2.926565 2.926565
#> 2 modestly-weighted (s_star = 0.5) 2.773749 2.773749
```

The component statistics agree in absolute value. The null correlation
of the two components, reported in the `corr` attribute, matches the
covariance computed by the authors’ `find_cor` routine to numerical
precision. The combined statistic and one-sided p-value then follow from
the bivariate normal distribution of the two components, evaluated with
[`mvtnorm::pmvnorm`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/mvtnorm/man/pmvnorm.html). On
the POPLAR overall-survival data analyzed in the original article,
[`rmw_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/rmw_fast.md)
reproduces the published one-sided p-values of 0.0028 for the log-rank
test, 0.0009 for the modestly-weighted test, and 0.0012 for the rMW
test, with a component correlation of 0.97.

## Summary

Across all functions the FastSurvival results reproduce the reference
values on the `gbsg` data. The point estimates and test statistics agree
to numerical precision for the Kaplan-Meier, log-rank, weighted
log-rank, RMST, milestone, median, and average-hazard quantities; the
window mean survival time matches a Kaplan-Meier integral and the
weighted Kaplan-Meier statistic matches the RMST identity; the average
hazard ratio matches a survival-based reference; and the closed-form Cox
hazard ratio agrees with the partial-likelihood maximizer to the order
expected for the Pike-Halley approximation. This agreement is verified
continuously by the package test suite.

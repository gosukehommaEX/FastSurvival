Description: Provides fast implementations of log-rank test statistics, hazard ratio 
    estimation using multiple methods, and simulation functions for survival data. 
    The package includes functions for piecewise exponential and piecewise uniform 
    distributions, and efficient data simulation for clinical trials with time-to-event 
    endpoints. All functions are optimized for performance compared to standard 
    survival analysis packages.

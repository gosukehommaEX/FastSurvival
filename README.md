FastSurvival provides fast alternatives to the standard survival analysis
functions in the
[survival](https://cran.r-project.org/package=survival) package, together
with a simulation layer for designing and evaluating time-to-event trials.
Every function is designed for repeated evaluation inside large simulation
loops — adaptive sample-size re-estimation, probability-of-success
calculations, regional consistency evaluation in multi-regional trials —
where the standard iterative or object-building overhead of `survfit()`,
`survdiff()`, and `coxph()` becomes a computational bottleneck. Core
computations are implemented in C++ via
[Rcpp](https://cran.r-project.org/package=Rcpp) for maximum performance.

The full documentation site, including function references and articles, is
available at <https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/>.

## Design principles

**survfit_fast** evaluates the Kaplan-Meier estimator at a single specified
time point. A C++ backend locates the evaluation cutoff via binary search,
then accumulates the Kaplan-Meier product and the Greenwood variance sum in
a single scan over event positions, without constructing intermediate
vectors. This makes it orders of magnitude faster than `survfit()` plus
`summary()` when the same sorted data are evaluated repeatedly at a fixed
landmark time inside a simulation loop.

**survdiff_fast** computes the log-rank statistic using a two-pointer merge
scan over the pooled sorted data, walking the time axis once while
maintaining per-group at-risk counters and processing tied event times
atomically. The C++ backend avoids the rank construction, `tabulate()`, and
reverse cumulative sum operations of the standard R implementation, and the
function itself bypasses the S3 object construction and formula parsing of
`survdiff()`. Beyond the ordinary unweighted test, it supports the
Fleming-Harrington, modestly-weighted, Gehan-Breslow, and Tarone-Ware
weighted tests, as well as stratified and stratified-weighted variants, all
sharing the same single-scan backend.

**coxph_fast** implements the Pike-Halley Estimator proposed by Homma
(2025), a closed-form approximation to the Cox partial likelihood maximizer.
The estimator anchors at the Pike closed-form estimate and applies a single
analytic Halley correction to the Cox score, giving residual error of order
O_p(n^{-3/2}) relative to the Cox maximum likelihood estimate. On the
`pharmacoSmoking` dataset (tie rate 77.5%), the Pike-Halley Estimator
reproduces the Breslow-based Cox estimate to within on the order of 1e-08.
The Wald confidence interval uses the observed information at the Pike
anchor as the variance estimate. The C++ backend performs group splitting,
at-risk counting, and per-distinct-event-time accumulation in a single pass.

**rmst_fast** integrates the Kaplan-Meier survival step function up to a
horizon in a single C++ scan, reused once per group. With a single group it
returns the RMST with a Greenwood-type standard error and a Wald confidence
interval; with two groups it adds the RMST difference and ratio contrasts,
each with a standard error, confidence interval, and two-sided test.

**milestone_fast** compares the Kaplan-Meier survival probabilities of two
groups at a prespecified milestone timepoint, estimating the difference
(treatment minus control). Three inference methods are provided: a Greenwood
Wald interval, and two methods that build the difference interval by the
method of variance estimates recovery (MOVER) from complementary log-log and
log transformed one-sample intervals, following Tang (2021).

**maxcombo_fast** computes the max-combo test, the maximum over a set of
Fleming-Harrington weighted log-rank statistics, for comparing survival
under non-proportional hazards. The C++ backend evaluates every weighted
numerator and the full between-scheme covariance matrix in a single scan,
and the p-value follows from the implied multivariate normal distribution.
Taking the most extreme of several complementary weights makes the test
robust to the shape of the hazard difference, with the multiplicity
accounted for through the joint distribution.

**rmw_fast** computes the robust modestly-weighted (rMW) test of Magirr and
Öhrn (2026), the maximum of the standard log-rank statistic and a single
modestly-weighted log-rank statistic. The modestly-weighted component uses
the survival-threshold parameterization, with the weight capped at the
reciprocal of `s_star` (so `s_star = 0.5` caps the weight at 2 and `s_star = 1`
recovers the log-rank test). The C++ backend computes both component
numerators, both variances, and their null covariance in a single scan, and
the combined statistic and p-value follow from the implied bivariate normal
distribution. Because the standard log-rank statistic is one of the two
components and the components are strongly correlated under the null, the
multiplicity adjustment is small, so the test loses little power relative to
the log-rank test in worst-case scenarios while gaining power under delayed
effects.

**ahsw_fast** computes the average hazard with survival weight of Uno and
Horiguchi for two groups. The average hazard on the window up to a horizon
is the ratio of the cumulative event probability to the restricted mean
survival time, both from the Kaplan-Meier estimate. The function returns the
per-group average hazard, the ratio of average hazards (RAH) on the log
scale, and the difference of average hazards (DAH) on the identity scale,
each with a confidence interval and a two-sided test.

**ahr_fast** computes the average hazard ratio of Kalbfleisch and Prentice
(1981) between two groups over a restricted interval, the estimator used by
Dormuth et al. (2024) for sample-size calculation under non-proportional
hazards. Writing the two survival functions as S0 and S1, each group's share
of the total hazard is obtained by integrating one survival curve against the
increments of the other; the average hazard ratio is the ratio of the two
shares, and equals the true hazard ratio under proportional hazards. A C++
backend builds both Kaplan-Meier curves and their Greenwood variances on the
pooled event grid, then evaluates the shares, their direct variances, and the
double-integral covariance terms in linear scans. The primary test is on the
group-share scale, as in the source method, with an equivalent test and a
confidence interval reported on the log scale.

**simdata_fast** generates individual patient data for one- or two-group
time-to-event trials. Accrual times follow a piecewise-uniform distribution,
and survival and dropout times follow either a simple or piecewise
exponential distribution, selected automatically based on whether a scalar
or vector hazard is supplied. Optional subgroups are defined by a prevalence
specification. The entire generation pipeline runs in a single C++ kernel
that materializes the output data frame once, avoiding intermediate R-level
vector operations and copies, and random-number generation uses
[dqrng](https://cran.r-project.org/package=dqrng) for speed.

**analysis_fast** performs interim or sequential analyses of simulated
two-group data at one or more looks, defined either by a target cumulative
number of events or by a calendar time. At every look the data are
administratively censored at the corresponding calendar cutoff, and the
requested statistics are computed for each simulated trial. The censoring,
time sorting, and per-cell statistics are handled by a fused C++ kernel that
reuses the same analysis cores as the standalone functions, so the same
results are obtained without the per-iteration overhead of repeated wrapper
calls. Statistics can also be reported within each subgroup.

**simsummary_fast** aggregates the per-simulation, per-look output of
`analysis_fast()` into operating characteristics: the rejection rate, the
futility-stopping rate, the distribution of the stopping look, and the
expected analysis timing. It consumes group-sequential boundaries computed
elsewhere (for example by gsDesign or rpact) and estimates the stopping
probabilities by Monte Carlo over the simulated trials; it does not compute
or spend alpha itself.

## Using the functions together

A typical simulation workflow combines the simulation and analysis layers.
`simdata_fast()` generates the data once, `analysis_fast()` performs the
looks and computes the statistics for every simulated trial, and
`simsummary_fast()` aggregates the operating characteristics against the
supplied boundaries:

```r
library(FastSurvival)

# 1. Simulate a two-group trial with a delayed treatment effect
df <- simdata_fast(
  nsim     = 1000,
  n        = c(350, 350),
  a.time   = c(0, 12),
  a.rate   = 700 / 12,
  e.hazard = list(c(0.08, 0.08), c(0.08, 0.04)),
  e.time   = c(0, 6, Inf),
  d.hazard = list(0.01, 0.01),
  seed     = 42
)

# 2. Analyze at two interim looks defined by target event counts
res <- analysis_fast(
  df, control = 1,
  event.looks = c(300, 450),
  stat = "logrank", side = 1
)

# 3. Summarize operating characteristics against efficacy boundaries
#    (nominal levels from a group-sequential design, e.g. gsDesign)
oc <- simsummary_fast(
  res,
  p.col = "logrank.p",
  alpha = c(0.0006, 0.0238)
)
oc
```

The estimation functions can also be used directly inside a loop. Each
returned object is internally a numeric vector, so after stripping the class
with `unclass()` the per-simulation results can be combined with `rbind()`
into an ordinary numeric matrix:

```r
results <- vector("list", 1000L)
for (s in seq_len(1000L)) {
  d <- df[df$sim == s, ]
  results[[s]] <- coxph_fast(d$tte, d$event, d$group, control = 1)
}

hr_mat <- do.call(rbind, lapply(results, unclass))
colMeans(hr_mat)
```

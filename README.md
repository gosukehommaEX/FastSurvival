FastSurvival provides fast alternatives to the standard survival analysis
functions in the
[survival](https://cran.r-project.org/package=survival) package.
Every function is designed for repeated evaluation inside large simulation
loops — adaptive sample-size re-estimation, probability-of-success
calculations, regional consistency evaluation in multi-regional trials —
where the standard iterative or object-building overhead of `survfit()`,
`survdiff()`, and `coxph()` becomes a computational bottleneck. Core
computations are implemented in C++ via
[Rcpp](https://cran.r-project.org/package=Rcpp) for maximum performance.

## Functions

| Function | Replaces | Approximate speed gain |
|----------|----------|------------------------|
| `survfit_fast()` | `survfit()` + `summary()` at a single time point | ~100x |
| `survdiff_fast()` | `survdiff()` | ~100x |
| `coxph_fast()` | `coxph()` (point estimate + Wald CI) | ~100x |
| `simdata_fast()` | Custom simulation scripts | — |

Speed gains are based on median times from microbenchmark replicates on a
typical phase-3 trial dataset (n = 600, event rate 80%). Results vary by
hardware and sample size.

## Design principles

**survfit_fast** evaluates the Kaplan-Meier estimator at a single specified
time point. A C++ backend locates the evaluation cutoff via binary search,
then accumulates the Kaplan-Meier product and the Greenwood variance sum in
a single scan over event positions, without constructing intermediate
vectors. This makes it orders of magnitude faster than `survfit()` plus
`summary()` when the same sorted data are evaluated repeatedly at a fixed
landmark time inside a simulation loop.

**survdiff_fast** computes the log-rank statistic using a two-pointer merge
scan over the pooled sorted data, walking the time axis once while
maintaining per-group at-risk counters and processing tied event times
atomically. The C++ backend avoids the rank construction, `tabulate()`, and
reverse cumulative sum operations of the standard R implementation, and the
function itself bypasses the S3 object construction and formula parsing of
`survdiff()`. It returns either a one-sided Z-score (`side = 1`) or a
two-sided chi-square statistic (`side = 2`).

**coxph_fast** implements the Pike-Halley Estimator proposed by Homma
(2025), a closed-form approximation to the Cox partial likelihood maximizer.
The estimator anchors at the Pike closed-form estimate and applies a single
analytic Halley correction to the Cox score, giving residual error of order
O_p(n^{-3/2}) relative to the Cox maximum likelihood estimate. On the
`pharmacoSmoking` dataset (tie rate 77.5%), the Pike-Halley Estimator
reproduces the Breslow-based Cox estimate to within on the order of 1e-08.
The Wald confidence interval uses the observed information at the Pike
anchor as the variance estimate. The C++ backend performs group splitting,
at-risk counting, and per-distinct-event-time accumulation in a single pass.

**simdata_fast** generates individual patient data for one- or two-group
time-to-event trials. Accrual times follow a piecewise uniform distribution.
Survival and dropout times follow either a simple or piecewise exponential
distribution, selected automatically based on whether a scalar or vector
hazard is supplied. C++ backends handle piecewise sampling and two-group
interleaving, and random number generation uses
[dqrng](https://cran.r-project.org/package=dqrng) for speed.

## Using the functions together

A typical simulation workflow combines all four functions:

```r
library(FastSurvival)

results <- vector("list", 1000L)

df <- simdata_fast(
  nsim     = 1000,
  n        = c(100, 100),
  a.time   = c(0, 12),
  a.rate   = 200 / 12,
  e.hazard = list(0.08, 0.05),
  d.hazard = list(0.01, 0.01),
  seed     = 42
)

for (s in seq_len(1000L)) {
  d <- df[df$sim == s, ]
  results[[s]] <- coxph_fast(d$tte, d$event, d$group, control = 1)
}

hr_mat <- do.call(rbind, results)
colMeans(hr_mat)
```

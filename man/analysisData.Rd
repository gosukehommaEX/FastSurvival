\title{Create analysis datasets from clinical trial simulation data}
\usage{
analysisData(data, E = NULL, followup = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data.table containing simulation data generated by \code{\link{simTrial}}.
Must contain columns: simID, group, accrual.time, surv.time, dropout.time,
tte, total, dropout. May optionally contain subgroup column.}

\item{E}{A numeric vector specifying the target number of events for each analysis.
Each element represents a different analysis timepoint (e.g., interim, final).
Cannot be used with followup. Default is NULL.}

\item{followup}{A numeric vector specifying the follow-up times for each analysis.
Each element represents the calendar time from study start for analysis.
Cannot be used with E. Default is NULL.}
}
\value{
A data.table containing the analysis datasets with the following columns:
\describe{
\item{analysis}{Analysis number (1, 2, 3, ...) corresponding to each element in E or followup}
\item{simID}{Simulation iteration ID (1 to nsim)}
\item{group}{Group indicator (1, 2, 3, ...)}
\item{subgroup}{Subgroup indicator (A, B, C, ...) - only present if subgroups are specified}
\item{accrual.time}{Patient accrual time from study start}
\item{surv.time}{Original survival time from patient entry}
\item{dropout.time}{Original dropout time from patient entry}
\item{tte}{Time-to-event (adjusted for analysis cutoff)}
\item{total}{Original total time from study start}
\item{dropout}{Original dropout indicator from simTrial}
\item{analysis.time}{Analysis cutoff time (calendar time from study start)}
\item{event}{Event indicator for analysis (1 = event occurred by cutoff, 0 = censored at cutoff)}
}
}
\description{
This function creates analysis datasets from simulation data generated by simTrial()
based on either target number of events or follow-up times for interim and final
analyses using data.table for maximum performance. It handles data cutoffs and
censoring appropriately for time-to-event analysis.
}
\details{
This function is essential for simulating adaptive trial designs and interim analyses.
It supports two main approaches:

\describe{
\item{Event-driven Analysis (E parameter)}{
Analysis is triggered when a target number of events is observed across all
groups. The analysis time is determined as the calendar time when the E-th
event occurs. This is common in oncology trials where analyses are performed
after accumulating a predetermined number of deaths.
}
\item{Time-driven Analysis (followup parameter)}{
Analysis is performed at predetermined calendar times from study start,
regardless of the number of events observed. This is common in cardiovascular
trials with planned interim analyses at fixed timepoints.
}
}

For each analysis, the function:
\itemize{
\item Determines the appropriate analysis cutoff time
\item Adjusts time-to-event data for patients not yet recruited at cutoff
\item Censors events occurring after the cutoff time
\item Creates appropriate event indicators for statistical analysis
}

The resulting dataset can be used directly with survival analysis functions
like \code{\link{lrtest}} and \code{\link{esthr}}.

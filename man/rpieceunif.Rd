\title{Generate random numbers from piecewise uniform distribution}
\usage{
rpieceunif(n, time, intensity = NULL, proportion = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{A positive integer specifying the number of observations to generate.}

\item{time}{A numeric vector of time points defining the intervals.
The length of time should be one more than the length of intensity or proportion.}

\item{intensity}{A numeric vector of intensities (rate per time unit) for each interval.
The length should be one less than the length of time. Cannot be used with proportion.}

\item{proportion}{A numeric vector of proportions for each interval that sum to 1.
The length should be one less than the length of time. Cannot be used with intensity.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of random numbers from the piecewise uniform distribution.
}
\description{
This function generates random numbers from a piecewise uniform distribution
where each time interval has a different intensity (rate per time unit) or
a specified proportion of observations.
}
\examples{
# Generate 100 random numbers with time intervals [0,6), [6,12), [12,18), [18,24)
# and intensities that sum to 100 total expected observations
time <- c(0, 6, 12, 18, 24)
intensity <- c(100/(6*4), 100/(6*4), 100/(6*4), 100/(6*4))  # Equal intensity per interval
samples <- rpieceunif(100, time, intensity)
hist(samples, main = "Piecewise Uniform Distribution")

# Generate 100 random numbers with specified proportions
time <- c(0, 6, 12, 18, 24)
proportion <- c(0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4)
samples2 <- rpieceunif(100, time, proportion = proportion)
hist(samples2, main = "Piecewise Uniform with Proportions")

# Example with single interval where intensity * interval length = n
time2 <- c(0, 10)
intensity2 <- 5  # 5 * 10 = 50
samples3 <- rpieceunif(50, time2, intensity2)
hist(samples3, main = "Single Interval with Matching Expected Count")

\title{Generate random numbers from piecewise Poisson distribution}
\usage{
rpiecepois(n, time, rate, continuous = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{A positive integer specifying the number of observations to generate.}

\item{time}{A numeric vector of time points defining the start of each interval.
The length of time should be equal to the length of rate.
Time points must be in strictly increasing order. The final interval
extends to infinity with the last rate.}

\item{rate}{A numeric vector of rate parameters (events per time unit) for each interval.
The length should be equal to the length of time.
All rates must be non-negative.}

\item{continuous}{A logical value indicating the type of time generation.
If TRUE, generates continuous event times within each time unit using uniform
distribution (realistic for arrival processes). If FALSE, generates discrete
integer event times (appropriate for daily/monthly counting). Default is FALSE.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of random numbers from the piecewise Poisson distribution.
If continuous = TRUE, returns real-valued event times sorted in ascending order.
If continuous = FALSE, returns integer-valued event times representing discrete
time points where events occur.
}
\description{
This function generates random numbers from a piecewise Poisson distribution
where each time interval has a different rate parameter. This is particularly
useful for modeling event arrivals or patient enrollment in clinical trials
where the arrival rate changes over time.
}
\details{
The piecewise Poisson distribution allows for modeling event arrival processes
where the rate changes at pre-specified time points. This is commonly used in
clinical trial simulations for patient enrollment modeling.

The rate function is defined as:
\deqn{\lambda(t) = \lambda_j \quad \text{for } t_{j-1} \leq t < t_j}
where \eqn{\lambda_j} is the rate parameter in interval \eqn{j}.

\strong{Discrete Mode (continuous = FALSE)}:
For each integer time point t in interval j, generates Poisson(λ_j) events
occurring exactly at time t. This mimics the original discrete-time approach
where events are counted at regular intervals.

\strong{Continuous Mode (continuous = TRUE)}:
For each time unit [t, t+1) in interval j, generates Poisson(λ_j) events
and places them uniformly within the time unit. This provides a more realistic
continuous-time Poisson process approximation.

The algorithm uses an efficient vectorized approach that:
\itemize{
\item Calculates expected counts per time unit for each interval
\item Generates Poisson counts for all time units simultaneously
\item Handles discrete or continuous positioning based on the continuous parameter
\item Extends generation beyond specified intervals if needed to reach sample size n

\title{Generate random numbers from piecewise exponential distribution}
\usage{
rpieceexp(n, time, hazard)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{A positive integer specifying the number of observations to generate.}

\item{time}{A numeric vector of time points defining the intervals.
The length of time should be one more than the length of hazard.
The last element must be Inf to represent the final open interval.
Time points must be in strictly increasing order.}

\item{hazard}{A numeric vector of hazard rates for each interval.
The length should be one less than the length of time.
All hazard rates must be positive.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of random numbers from the piecewise exponential distribution.
}
\description{
This function generates random numbers from a piecewise exponential distribution
where each time interval has a different hazard rate. This implementation follows
established methodologies and is commonly used for modeling time-to-event data
with non-constant hazard rates over time.
}
\details{
The piecewise exponential distribution allows for modeling survival times where
the hazard rate changes at pre-specified time points. This is particularly useful
for clinical trials where treatment effects may be delayed or where the underlying
risk changes over time.

The hazard function is defined as:
\deqn{h(t) = h_j \quad \text{for } t_{j-1} \leq t < t_j}
where \eqn{h_j} is the hazard rate in interval \eqn{j}.

The survival function is:
\deqn{S(t) = \exp\left(-\sum_{j=1}^{k-1} h_j (t_j - t_{j-1}) - h_k (t - t_{k-1})\right)}
where \eqn{t_{k-1} \leq t < t_k}.

\examples{
# Standard exponential distribution (single interval)
time1 <- c(0, Inf)
hazard1 <- 0.1
samples1 <- rpieceexp(1000, time1, hazard1)
hist(samples1, main = "Standard Exponential Distribution",
     xlab = "Time", probability = TRUE, breaks = 30)

# Piecewise exponential with increasing hazard
time2 <- c(0, 5, 10, Inf)
hazard2 <- c(0.05, 0.15, 0.25)
samples2 <- rpieceexp(1000, time2, hazard2)
hist(samples2, main = "Piecewise Exponential (Increasing Hazard)",
     xlab = "Time", probability = TRUE, breaks = 30)

# Clinical trial example: delayed treatment effect
time_trial <- c(0, 3, Inf)
hazard_control <- c(0.2, 0.2)
hazard_treatment <- c(0.2, 0.1)

control_times <- rpieceexp(500, time_trial, hazard_control)
treatment_times <- rpieceexp(500, time_trial, hazard_treatment)
